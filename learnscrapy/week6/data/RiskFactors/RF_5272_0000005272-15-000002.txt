otherwise mentioned or unless the context indicates otherwise, we use the terms
“AIG,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” to refer to American International Group,
Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries. We use the
term “AIG Parent” to refer solely to American International Group, Inc., and
not to any of its consolidated subsidiaries. AIG’s Global Insurance Operations business management On September 1, 2014, in accordance with AIG’s previously disclosed succession plan, Peter D. Hancock assumed the role of President and Chief Executive Officer of AIG and joined AIG’s Board of Directors. He succeeded Robert H. Benmosche, who retired and currently serves as an advisor to AIG. With this transition, Mr. Hancock has announced a new leadership team and structure aimed at integrating the Company and positioning us to deliver the full capabilities of AIG to our approximately 90 million clients around the world as One AIG. We believe that by striving to provide the greatest value to our customers, we can deliver improved operating and financial performance and sustainable, profitable growth. Our strategy is focused on enhancing the value and competitive position of our insurance businesses and investing our capital where we can achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns, while maintaining strong levels of liquidity and capital. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we modified the presentation of our results to reflect our new operating structure. The new operating structure includes two reportable segments, Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance, and a Corporate and Other category. Commercial Insurance has three operating segments: Property Casualty, Mortgage Guaranty and Institutional Markets. Consumer Insurance also has three operating segments: Retirement, Life and Personal Insurance. The Corporate and Other category consists of businesses and items not allocated to our reportable segments. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2014, AIG reported its results through two reportable segments – AIG Property Casualty and AIG Life and Retirement. Certain of our management activities, such as investment management, enterprise risk management, liquidity management and capital management, and our balance sheet reporting, are conducted on a legal entity basis. We group our insurance-related legal entities into two categories: Non-Life Insurance Companies and Life Insurance Companies. Non-Life Insurance Companies include the following major property casualty and mortgage guaranty companies: National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pa.(National Union); American Home Assurance Company (American Home); Lexington Insurance Company (Lexington); Fuji Fire and Marine Insurance Company Limited (Fuji Fire); American Home Assurance Company, Ltd. (American Home Japan); AIG Asia Pacific Insurance, Pte, Ltd.; AIG Europe Limited and United Guaranty Residential Insurance Company (UGRIC). Life Insurance Companies include the following major operating companies: American General Life Insurance Company (American General Life); The Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company (VALIC); The United States Life Insurance Company in the City of New York (U.S. Life) and AIG Fuji Life Insurance Company Limited (Fuji Life). 4 TABLE OF CONTENTS Item 1 / BUSINESS / AIG (a) Consists of Commercial Insurance and
Consumer Insurance pre-tax operating income. Pre-tax operating income and book
value per share excluding AOCI are non-GAAP measures. See “Use of Non-GAAP
Measures” for additional information. (b) Total
consideration of approximately $7.6 billion, includes net cash proceeds of $2.4
billion and 97.6 million newly issued AerCap common shares. Based in part on
AerCap's closing price per share of $47.01 on May 13, 2014, the date the sale
of ILFC to AerCap was completed. 5 TABLE OF CONTENTS Item 1 / BUSINESS / AIG How we
Generate Revenues and Profitability We earn
revenues primarily from insurance
premiums, policy fees from universal life insurance and investment products, and
income from investments and advisory fees. Our
operating expenses consist of
policyholder benefits and losses incurred, interest credited to policyholders,
commissions and other costs of selling and servicing our products, and general
business expenses. Our
profitability is de pendent on
our ability to properly price and manage risk on insurance and annuity
products, to manage our portfolio of investments effectively, and to control
costs through expense discipline. INVESTMENT
ACTIVITIES OF Our Insurance OPERATIONS Our Non Life Insurance Companies and Life Insurance Companies generally receive premiums and deposits well in advance of paying covered claims or benefits. In the intervening periods, we invest these premiums and deposits to generate net investment income that, along with the invested funds, is available to pay claims or benefits. As a result, we generate significant revenues from insurance investment activities. We generate significant revenues in our insurance operations from investment activities. Our worldwide insurance investment policy places primary emphasis on investments in corporate bonds, municipal bonds and government bonds in all of our portfolios, and, to a lesser extent, investments in high yield bonds, common stock, real estate, hedge funds and other alternative investments. The majority of assets backing our insurance liabilities
consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities. Non-Life Insurance Companies — F ixed maturity securities held by the insurance
companies included in the Non-Life Insurance Companies’ domestic operations
have historically consisted primarily of corporate bonds, municipal bonds and
government bonds. These investments provided attractive returns and limited
credit risk. To meet our domestic operations’ current risk return and business
objectives, our domestic Non-Life Insurance Companies have been shifting
investment allocations to a broader array of investments, including structured
securities, mortgage loans, equity related opportunities and other investments
that offer attractive risk-adjusted returns. Our fixed maturity securities must
meet our liquidity, duration and quality objectives as well as current capital,
risk return and business objectives. Fixed maturity securities held by the
Non-Life Insurance Companies’ international operations consist primarily of
intermediate duration high-grade securities, primarily in the markets being
served. In addition, the Non-Life Insurance Companies have redeployed cash in
excess of operating needs into investments consistent with the asset classes
described above. Life Insurance Companies — The investment strategy for the portfolios of the
Life Insurance Companies is largely to match the duration of our liabilities
with assets of comparable duration, to the extent practicable. The Life
Insurance Companies primarily invest in a diversified portfolio of fixed
maturity securities, which include corporate bonds and structured securities.
To further diversify the portfolio, investments are made in alternative
investments, including private equity funds, hedge funds and affordable housing
partnerships. Although these alternative investments are subject to periodic
earnings fluctuations, they have achieved total returns in excess of the Life
Insurance Companies’ fixed maturity security returns for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2014. 6 TABLE OF CONTENTS Item 1 / BUSINESS / AIG Commercial Insurance Consumer Insurance Commercial Insurance is a leading provider of insurance products and services for commercial and institutional customers. It includes one of the world’s most far-reaching property casualty networks, a leading mortgage guaranty insurer and an institutional retirement and savings business. Commercial Insurance offers a broad range of products to customers through a diversified, multichannel distribution network. Customers value Commercial Insurance’s strong capital position, extensive risk management and claims experience, and its ability to be a market leader in critical lines of insurance business. Consumer Insurance is a unique franchise that brings together a broad portfolio of retirement, life insurance and property casualty products offered through multiple distribution networks. It holds long-standing, leading market positions in many of its U.S. product lines, and its global footprint provides the opportunity to pursue international growth opportunities selectively in countries with attractive markets. With its strong capital position, customer-focused service, innovative product development capabilities and strong distribution relationships across multiple channels, Consumer Insurance is well positioned to provide clients with the products they need delivered through the channels they prefer. Corporate and Other Corporate and Other includes Direct Investment book, Global Capital Markets, and AIG Parent and Other as well as certain run-off insurance businesses. 7 TABLE OF CONTENTS Item 1 / BUSINESS / AIG Global Footprint Our Non-Life Insurance Companies net premiums written (NPW) of $34.5 billion in 2014 reflected our expansive global footprint. Based on NPW in 2013, we are the largest commercial insurer in the U.S., the largest U.S. based property casualty insurer in Europe, and the largest foreign property casualty insurer in China. In addition, AIG was first to market in many emerging markets and is well positioned to enhance its businesses in countries such as Brazil, China through strategic relationships with People’s Insurance Company (Group) of China Limited (PICC Group), and India with the Tata Group. Our Life Insurance Companies premiums and deposits (P&D) of $32.6 billion in 2014 demonstrate a substantial presence in the U.S. and a meaningful share of the Japan market. P&D is a non-GAAP financial measure that includes direct and assumed amounts received on traditional life insurance policies, group benefit policies and deposits on life‑contingent payout annuities, as well as deposits received on universal life, investment‑type annuity contracts and mutual funds. See Item 7. MD&A — Results of Operations for Institutional Markets, Retirement and Life for a reconciliation of P&D to premiums. We have a significant international presence in both
developed markets and growth economy nations, specifically in Asia Pacific,
Central Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. We distribute our
products through three major geographic regions: • Americas: Includes the United States, Canada, Latin America, the Caribbean and Bermuda. • Asia Pacific: Includes Japan, China, Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Australia,
Indonesia and other Asia Pacific nations. • EMEA (Europe,
Middle East and Africa): Includes the United Kingdom, Continental Europe,
the Russian Federation, India, the Middle East and Africa. In 2014, 6.3 percent of our property casualty direct premiums
were written in the state of California and 15.7 percent and 7.5 percent were
written in Japan and the United Kingdom, respectively. No other state or foreign
jurisdiction accounted for more than five percent of such premiums. 8 TABLE OF CONTENTS Item 1 / BUSINESS / AIG Diversified Mix of Businesses* (dollars

foreign insurance operations of large global insurance groups and local
companies in specific market areas and product types. Mortgage Guaranty
competes with several private providers of mortgage insurance, both
well-established and new entrants to the industry, and the Federal Housing
Administration, which is the largest provider of mortgage insurance in the
United States. Institutional Markets competes with large domestic (both stock

Consumer
Insurance Competition Consumer Insurance operates in the highly competitive
insurance and financial services industry in the U.S. and select international
markets and competes against various financial services companies, including
mutual funds, banks and other life and property casualty insurance companies. Competition is primarily based on product pricing and design, distribution,
financial strength, customer service and ease of doing business. Consumer Insurance competes based on its long‑standing
market leading positions, innovative products, strong distribution
relationships across multiple channels, customer-focused service and strong
financial ratings. 16 TABLE OF CONTENTS Item 1 / BUSINESS / consumer insurance Consumer Insurance Competitive Strengths and Challenges Our competitive strengths include: Unique franchise – broad portfolio of retirement, life insurance and personal insurance products offered through multiple distribution networks Market leader – long-standing, leading positions in many of our product lines and key distribution channels Global footprint – ability to selectively pursue international growth opportunities in countries with attractive markets Strong distribution relationships across multiple channels – opportunity to expand on distribution relationships to effectively market diverse product offerings Information and science capabilities – used to build decision tools, transform processes and optimize performance Customer-focused service – investments in technology and operating platforms provide the foundation to deliver our target customer experience Risk diversification and scale – breadth of product offerings and scale advantage in key product lines Capital strength – capacity to drive growth in attractive markets and product lines Our challenges include: Highly competitive environment where products are differentiated by pricing, terms, customer service and ease of doing business and barriers to entry are significant in certain markets Regulatory requirements in recent years have created an increasingly complex environment that is affecting industry growth and profitability Low interest rate environment makes it more difficult to competitively price guaranteed return products and puts margin pressure on existing products due to the challenge of investing in a low rate environment Corporate and Other includes: Direct Investment book (DIB) consists of a portfolio of assets and
liabilities held directly by AIG Parent in the Matched Investment Program (MIP)
and certain non-derivative assets
and liabilities of AIG Financial Products Corp. and related subsidiaries (collectively AIGFP) . The DIB portfolio
is being wound down and is managed with the objective of ensuring that at all
times it maintains the liquidity we believe is necessary to meet all of its
liabilities as they come due, even under stress scenarios, and to maximize
returns consistent with our risk management objectives. Global Capital Markets (GCM) consists of the operations of AIG Markets, Inc. ( AIG Markets) and the remaining derivatives
portfolio of AIGFP. AIG Markets acts as the derivatives intermediary between
our subsidiaries and third parties to provide hedging services. The AIGFP
portfolio continues to be wound down and is managed consistently with our risk
management objectives. Although the portfolio
may experience periodic fair value volatility, it consists predominantly of
transactions that we believe are of low complexity, low risk or currently not
economically appropriate to unwind based on a cost versus benefit analysis. AIG Parent and Other consists primarily of interest expense, consolidation and
eliminations, expenses of corporate staff not attributable to specific
reportable segments, certain expenses related to internal controls and the
financial and operating 17 TABLE OF CONTENTS Item 1 / BUSINESS / consumer insurance platforms, corporate initiatives,
certain compensation plan expenses, corporate level net realized capital gains
and losses, certain litigation‑related charges and credits, net gain
(loss) on sale of divested businesses that did not meet the criteria for
discontinued operations accounting treatment, and equity in the earnings of
AerCap. Run-off Insurance Business consists primarily of run-off lines of
business, including excess workers’ compensation, asbestos and legacy
environmental (1986 and prior); certain environmental liability businesses
written prior to 2004 and certain
long-duration business, primarily in Japan and the U.S. Other Businesses include investments in life settlements, real estate
investment operations, institutional asset management operations, equipment
financing operations and our remaining consumer finance business. Aircraft Leasing consists of ILFC. On May 14, 2014, we completed the sale of 100 percent
of the common stock of ILFC to AerCap Ireland Limited, a wholly owned
subsidiary of AerCap, in exchange for total consideration of approximately
$7.6 billion, including cash and 97.6 million newly issued AerCap common
shares (the AerCap Transaction). As a result of the
AerCap Transaction, we own approximately 46 percent of the outstanding common
stock of AerCap. We account for our interest in AerCap using the equity method
of accounting. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information on the AerCap Transaction. Retained Interests includes fair value gains and losses on (i) AIA
ordinary shares retained following the AIA initial public offering prior to
their sale in 2012 and (ii) Maiden Lane III LLC (ML III) assets prior to
their liquidation in 2012. OUR EMPLOYEES At
December 31, 2014, we had approximately 65,000 employees. We believe that
our relations with our employees are satisfactory. 18 TABLE OF CONTENTS Item 1 / BUSINESS A Review of Liability for
Unpaid LOSSES and loss Adjustment Expenses The liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses
(also referred to as loss reserves) represents the accumulation of estimates
for unpaid reported losses (case reserves) and losses that have been incurred
but not reported (IBNR) for the Non-Life Insurance Companies. We recognize as assets the portion of this liability that is
expected to be recovered from reinsurers. Loss reserves are discounted, where
permitted, in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Loss Reserve Development
Process The process of establishing the liability for unpaid losses
and loss adjustment expenses is complex and imprecise because it must take into
consideration many variables that are subject to the outcome of future events.
As a result, informed subjective estimates and judgments about our ultimate
exposure to losses are an integral component of our loss reserving process. We use a number of techniques to analyze the adequacy of the established net liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (net loss reserves). Using these analytical techniques, we monitor the adequacy of our established reserves and determine appropriate assumptions for inflation and other factors influencing loss costs. Our analyses also take into account emerging specific development patterns, such as case reserve redundancies or deficiencies and IBNR emergence. We also consider specific factors that may impact losses, such as changing trends in medical costs, unemployment levels and other economic indicators, as well as changes in legislation and social attitudes that may affect decisions to file claims or the magnitude of court awards. See Item 7. MD&A — Critical Accounting Estimates for a description of our loss reserving process. Because reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events, changes in prior year estimates are unavoidable in the insurance industry. These changes in estimates are sometimes referred to as “prior year loss development” or “reserve development.” A significant portion of the Non-Life Insurance Companies’
reserves are for the U.S. commercial casualty class, including excess casualty,
asbestos and environmental, which tends to involve longer periods of time for
the reporting and settlement of claims than other types of insurance and
therefore may increase the inherent risk and uncertainty with respect to our loss
reserve development. Analysis of Consolidated Loss
Reserve Development The “Analysis of Consolidated Loss Reserve Development” table
presents the development of prior year net loss reserves for calendar years
2004 through 2014 for each balance sheet in that period. The information in the
table is presented in accordance with reporting requirements of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC). This table should be interpreted with care by
those not familiar with its format or those who are familiar with other loss
development analyses arranged in an accident year or underwriting year basis
rather than the balance sheet, as shown below. See Note 13 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. The top row of the table shows Net Reserves Held (the
net liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses) at each balance
sheet date, net of discount. This liability represents the estimated amount
of losses and loss adjustment expenses for claims arising in all years prior to
the balance sheet date that were unpaid as of that balance sheet date,
including estimates for IBNR claims. The amount of loss reserve discount
included in the net reserves at each date is shown immediately below the net
reserves held. The undiscounted reserve at each date is equal to the sum of the
discount and the net reserves held. For example, Net Reserves Held
(Undiscounted) was $48.8 billion at December 31, 2004. The next section of the table shows the original Net
Undiscounted Reserves re-estimated over 10 years. This re-estimation takes
into consideration a number of factors, including changes in the estimated
frequency of reported claims, effects of 19 TABLE OF CONTENTS Item 1 / BUSINESS significant
judgments, the emergence of latent exposures, and changes in medical cost
trends. For example, the original undiscounted reserve of
$48.8 billion at December 31, 2004, was re-estimated to $66.2 billion
at December 31, 2014. The amount of the development related to losses
settled or re-estimated in 2014, but incurred in 2011, is included in the
cumulative development amount for years 2011, 2012 and 2013. Any increase or
decrease in the estimate is reflected in operating results in the period in
which the estimate is changed. The middle of the table shows Net Deficiency. This
is the aggregate change in estimates over the period of years covered by the
table. For example, the net loss reserve deficiency of $17.4 billion
for 2004 is the difference between the original undiscounted reserve of
$48.8 billion at December 31, 2004 and the $66.2 billion of
re-estimated reserves at December 31, 2014. The net deficiency amounts are
cumulative; in other words, the amount shown in the 2013 column includes the
amount shown in the 2012 column, and so on. Conditions and trends that have affected
development of the liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the
future. Accordingly, it generally is not appropriate to extrapolate future
development based on this table. The bottom portion of the table shows the Paid
(Cumulative) amounts during successive years related to the undiscounted
loss reserves. For example, as of December 31, 2014, AIG had paid a total
of $55.4 billion of the $66.2 billion in re-estimated reserves for
2004, resulting in Remaining Reserves (Undiscounted) of $10.8 billion for
2004. Also included in this section are the Remaining Reserves
(Undiscounted) and the Remaining Discount for each year. As discussed
in footnotes (a) and (b) below, the calendar year distribution of these Paid
(Cumulative) amounts are estimates that are affected by certain transactions.
These payment amounts may differ from the actual losses paid for a given
accident year. The following table presents loss reserves and the
related loss development for 2004 through 2014 and consolidated gross liability
(before discount), reinsurance recoverable and net liability recorded for each

2009, we deconsolidated Transatlantic Holdings, Inc. and sold 21st Century
Insurance Group and HSB Group, Inc. The sales and deconsolidation are reflected
in the table above as a reduction in December 31, 2009 net reserves of $9.7
billion and as an $8.6 billion increase in paid losses for the years 2000
through 2008 to remove the reserves for these divested entities from the ending
balance. (b) The
increase in Net Reserves Held from 2009 to 2010 is partially due to the $1.7
billion in Net Reserves Held by Fuji Fire, which was acquired in 2010. The
decrease in 2011 is due to the cession of asbestos reserves described in Item
7. MD&A — Insurance Reserves – Non-Life Insurance Companies— Asbestos
and Environmental Reserves. The Liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses
as reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2014 differs from
the total reserves reported in the annual statements filed with state insurance
departments and, when applicable, with foreign regulatory authorities primarily
for the following reasons: • Reserves for certain foreign operations are not required or permitted to
be reported in the United States for statutory reporting purposes, including
contingency reserves for catastrophic events; • Statutory practices in the United States require reserves to be shown
net of applicable reinsurance recoverable; and • Unlike statutory financial statements, our consolidated liability for
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses excludes the effect of intercompany
transactions. Gross loss reserves are calculated without reduction for
reinsurance recoverable and represent the accumulation of estimates for
reported losses and IBNR, net of estimated salvage and subrogation. We review
the adequacy of established gross loss reserves in the manner previously
described for net loss reserves. A reconciliation of activity in the Liability
for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is included in Note 13 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. For further discussion of asbestos and environmental
reserves, see Item 7. MD&A — Insurance Reserves – Non-Life Insurance
Companies— Asbestos and Environmental Reserves. Reinsurance
Activities Reinsurance is used primarily to manage overall capital
adequacy and mitigate the insurance loss exposure related to certain events
such as natural and man-made catastrophes. Our subsidiaries operate worldwide primarily by underwriting
and accepting risks for their direct account on a gross basis and reinsuring a
portion of the exposure on either an individual risk or an aggregate basis to
the extent those risks exceed the desired retention level. In
addition, as a condition of certain direct underwriting transactions, we are
required by clients, agents or regulation to cede all or a portion of risks to
specified reinsurance entities, such as captives, other insurers, local
reinsurers and compulsory pools. Over the last several years, the Non-Life Insurance Companies
revised the ceded reinsurance framework and strategy to improve capital
management and support our global product line risk and profitability
objectives. As a result of adopting the revised framework and strategy,
many individual reinsurance contracts were consolidated into more efficient
global programs and reinsurance ceded to third parties in support of risk and
capital management objectives has decreased for the full year 21 TABLE OF CONTENTS Item 1 / BUSINESS 2014 compared to 2013. We continually evaluate the
relative attractiveness of different forms of reinsurance contracts and
different markets that may be used to achieve our risk and profitability
objectives. Reinsurance markets include: • Traditional local and global reinsurance markets including those in the
United States, Bermuda, London and Europe, accessed directly and through
reinsurance intermediaries; • Capital markets through insurance-linked securities and collateralized
reinsurance transactions, such as catastrophe bonds, sidecars and similar
vehicles; and • Other insurers that engage in both direct and assumed reinsurance. The form of reinsurance that we may choose from time to time
will generally depend on whether we are seeking: • proportional
reinsurance, whereby we cede a specified percentage of premium and losses to
reinsurers; • non-proportional
or excess of loss reinsurance, whereby we cede all or a specified portion of
losses in excess of a specified amount on a per risk, per occurrence (including
catastrophe reinsurance) or aggregate basis; or • facultative contracts that reinsure individual policies. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve our subsidiaries from
their direct obligations to insureds. However, an effective reinsurance program
substantially mitigates our exposure to potentially significant losses. In certain markets, we are required to participate on a
proportional basis in reinsurance pools based on our relative share of direct
writings in those markets. Such mandatory reinsurance generally covers
higher-risk consumer exposures such as assigned-risk automobile and earthquake,
as well as certain commercial exposures such as workers’ compensation. In 2014, we continued our strategy to take advantage of the
pricing differential between traditional reinsurance markets and capital
markets. In December 2014, we entered into capital markets reinsurance
transactions, effective as of January 1, 2015, with Tradewynd Re Ltd., which
will provide $500 million of indemnity reinsurance protection against U.S.,
Caribbean, Canadian, Mexican and Gulf of Mexico named storms and U.S.,
Caribbean, Mexican and Canadian earthquakes. To fund its potential
obligations to AIG, Tradewynd Re Ltd. issued three tranches of notes, one with
a one-year term and two with three-year terms. The transaction provides
fully collateralized coverage against losses from the events described above on
a per-occurrence basis through December 2015 (on the one-year tranche) and
December 2017 (on the three-year tranches). As of January 2015, our outstanding
catastrophe bond issuances result in us having $925 million of indemnity
reinsurance protection outstanding in the capital markets. See Item 7. MD&A – Enterprise Risk
Management – Insurance Operations Risks – Non-Life Insurance
Companies Key Insurance Risks – Reinsurance Recoverable for a summary of
significant reinsurers. REGULATion Our
operations around the world are subject to regulation by many different types
of regulatory authorities, including insurance, securities, derivatives,
investment advisory and thrift regulators in the United States and abroad. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and
supervision by the states and jurisdictions in which they do business. The
insurance and financial services industries generally have been subject to
heightened regulatory scrutiny and supervision in recent years. 22 TABLE OF CONTENTS Item 1 / BUSINESS The following table provides a general
overview of our primary regulators and related bodies and a brief description
of their oversight with respect to us and our subsidiaries, including key
regulations or initiatives that we are currently, or may in the future be,
subject to. Such regulations and initiatives, both in the United States and
abroad, are discussed in more detail following the table. U.S. Federal Regulation Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB): Oversees and regulates financial institutions, including nonbank systemically important financial institutions (nonbank SIFIs). We are currently subject to the FRB’s examination, supervision and enforcement authority, and certain reporting requirements, as a nonbank SIFI. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC): Charters, regulates and supervises all national banks and federal savings associations. The OCC supervises and regulates AIG Federal Savings Bank, our trust-only federal thrift subsidiary. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC): Oversees and regulates the U.S. securities and security-based swap markets, U.S. mutual funds, U.S. broker-dealers and U.S. investment advisors. Principal regulator of the mutual funds offered by our broker-dealer subsidiaries. The SEC is in the process of implementing rules and regulations governing reporting, execution and margin requirements for security-based swaps entered into within the U.S or by U.S. persons. Our security-based swap activities conducted by GCM are likely to be subject to certain of these rules and regulations . Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC): Oversees and regulates the U.S. swap, commodities and futures markets. The CFTC has begun implementing and is continuing to implement rules and regulations governing reporting, execution, margin and other requirements for swaps entered into within the U.S. or involving U.S. persons. Our swap activities conducted by GCM are subject to certain of these rules and regulations. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank): Dodd-Frank has effected comprehensive changes to financial services regulation and subjects us, or may subject us, as applicable, to additional federal regulation, including: • enhanced prudential standards for nonbank SIFIs (including minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements, capital planning, stress tests, liquidity requirements, corporate governance requirements, contingent capital requirements, counterparty credit limits, an early remediation regime process and recovery and resolution planning); • limitations on proprietary trading or covered fund activities, if the FRB decides to impose certain elements of Section 619 of Dodd-Frank (referred to as the “Volcker Rule”) on nonbank SIFIs; • financial sector concentration limits; and • increased regulation and restrictions on derivatives markets and transactions. U.S. State Regulation State Insurance Regulators: Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and other jurisdictions in which they do business. Regulation is generally derived from statutes that delegate supervisory and regulatory powers to a state insurance regulator, and primarily relates to the insurer’s financial condition, corporate conduct and market conduct activities. NAIC Standards: The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) is a standard-setting and regulatory support organization created and governed by the chief insurance regulators from the 50 states, the District of Columbia and five U.S. territories. The NAIC itself is not a regulator, but through the NAIC, state insurance regulators establish standards and best practices, conduct peer review and coordinate regulatory oversight. Foreign Regulation Financial Stability Board (FSB): Consists of representatives of national financial authorities of the G20 nations. The FSB itself is not a regulator, but it coordinates the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes implementation of regulatory, supervisory and other financial policies. International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS): Represents insurance regulators and supervisors of more than 200 jurisdictions in nearly 140 countries and seeks to promote globally consistent insurance industry supervision. The IAIS itself is not a regulator, but the FSB has directed the IAIS to create standards on issues such as financial group supervision, capital and solvency standards, systemic economic risk and corporate governance and incorporate them into IAIS’ Insurance Core Principles (ICPs). The FSB also charged IAIS with developing a template for measuring systemic risks posed by insurer groups. Based on IAIS’ assessment template, the FSB identified AIG as a global systemically important insurer (G-SII), which may subject us to a policy framework that includes recovery and resolution planning requirements, enhanced group-wide supervision, enhanced liquidity and strategic risk management planning, basic capital requirements and higher loss absorbency capital requirements. The IAIS is also developing ComFrame, a Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups (IAIGs), which includes additional supervisory oversight based on its ICPs but also adds requirements and supervisory processes pertaining to the international business activities of IAIGs. In connection with ComFrame, the IAIS is in the process of developing a risk-based global insurance capital standard applicable to IAIGs. AIG currently meets the parameters set forth to define an IAIG. European Union (EU): Certain financial services firms with regulated entities in the EU, such as us, are subject to supplementary supervision, which seeks to enable supervisors to perform consolidated insurance group supervision at the level of the ultimate parent entity. The objective of supplementary supervision is to detect, monitor, manage and control group risks. The UK Prudential Regulatory Authority, the United Kingdom’s prudential regulator, is our EU supervisory coordinator. In addition, the Financial Conduct Authority has oversight of AIG’s European operations for consumer protection and competition matters. The EU has also established a set of regulatory requirements for EU derivatives activities under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) that include, among other things, risk mitigation, risk management and regulatory reporting, which are effective, and clearing requirements expected to become effective in 2015. The EU’s Solvency II Directive (2009/138/EEC) (Solvency II), which is expected to become effective in 2016, includes minimum capital and solvency requirements, governance requirements, risk management and public reporting standards. The impact on us will depend on whether the U.S. insurance regulatory regime is deemed “equivalent” to Solvency II; if the U.S. insurance regulatory regime is not equivalent, then we could be subjected to Solvency II standards. Regulation of Foreign Insurance Company Subsidiaries: Generally, our subsidiaries operating in foreign jurisdictions must satisfy local regulatory requirements. Our foreign operations are also regulated in various jurisdictions with respect to currency, policy language and terms, advertising, amount and type of security deposits, amount and type of reserves, amount and type of capital to be held, amount and type of local investment and the share of profits to be returned to policyholders on participating policies. Some foreign countries also regulate rates on various types of policies. 23 TABLE OF CONTENTS Item 1 / BUSINESS Federal Reserve
Supervision Due to the determination of the Financial Stability
Oversight Council (Council) that we should be regulated by the FRB as a nonbank
SIFI pursuant to Section 113 of Dodd-Frank, we have been since July 2013
subject to the FRB’s examination, supervision and enforcement authority, and
certain reporting requirements as a nonbank SIFI. Dodd-Frank requires that the
Council reevaluate its determination annually; however, the Council’s 2014
annual reevaluation did not result in a change to our nonbank SIFI status, and
we remain regulated by the FRB. Dodd-Frank has effected comprehensive changes to the
regulation of financial services in the United States and subjects us to
substantial additional federal regulation. Dodd-Frank directs existing and
newly-created government agencies and oversight bodies to promulgate
regulations implementing the law, an ongoing process that is under way and is
anticipated to continue over the next few years. As required by Dodd-Frank, the FRB has adopted enhanced
prudential standards (including minimum leverage and risk-based capital
requirements, requirements to submit annual capital plans to the FRB
demonstrating the ability to satisfy the required capital ratios under baseline
and stressed conditions, and stress-testing requirements ) for
bank holding companies with $50 billion (and in some cases, $10 billion) or
more in total consolidated assets and certain foreign banking organizations . The FRB 24 TABLE OF CONTENTS Item 1 / BUSINESS has also adopted liquidity
coverage ratio and supplemental leverage ratio requirements for a subset of
large banking organizations. These requirements do not apply to nonbank
SIFIs. Dodd-Frank authorizes the FRB to tailor its application of
enhanced prudential standards to different companies on an individual basis or
by category, and the FRB has indicated that it intends to assess the business
model, capital structure and risk profile of nonbank SIFIs to determine how
enhanced prudential standards should apply to them, and, if appropriate, to
tailor the application of these standards for nonbank SIFIs by order or regulation.
We cannot predict what enhanced prudential standards the FRB will promulgate
for nonbank SIFIs, either generally or as applicable to insurance businesses. The
FRB has exercised general examination, supervision and enforcement authority
over us since we were determined to be a nonbank SIFI in July 2013. The FRB
has focused its general supervisory authority over us in several areas,
including financial and control related reporting, oversight of a capital
planning and capital analysis and review process, model governance and
validation, operational risk management, recovery planning and resolution
planning. We cannot predict how the FRB’s continuing exercise of its general
supervisory authority over us as a nonbank SIFI will develop, although the FRB
could, as a prudential matter, for example, limit our ability to pay dividends,
repurchase shares of AIG Common Stock or acquire or enter into other
businesses. We cannot predict with certainty the requirements of the
regulations ultimately adopted or how or whether Dodd-Frank and such
regulations will affect the financial markets generally, impact our businesses,
results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, or require us to
raise additional capital or result in a downgrade of our credit ratings. In
2014, the FRB conducted a quantitative impact study to evaluate the potential
effects of a revised regulatory capital framework on nonbank SIFIs that are
substantially engaged in insurance underwriting activity. The FRB has not
released any results or conclusions related to this study. We also note
that in December 2014, Congress adopted changes to Section 171 of Dodd-Frank in
order to clarify that the FRB has the flexibility to tailor capital rules
specifically for certain insurance activities and is not bound to impose
capital standards and quantitative requirements generally applicable to insured
depository institutions and bank holding companies. We cannot predict
with any certainty, however, what capital rules, if any, the FRB may impose on
insurers. As a nonbank SIFI, we anticipate we will be subject to: • stress tests to determine whether, on a consolidated basis, we have the
capital necessary to absorb losses due to adverse economic conditions; • stricter prudential standards, including stricter requirements and
limitations relating to risk-based capital, leverage, liquidity and credit
exposure, as well as overall risk management requirements; • management interlock prohibitions and a requirement to maintain a plan
for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of severe financial distress
(requirements that we are already subject to); and • an early remediation regime process to be administered by the FRB. Furthermore, if the Council were to make an additional
separate determination that AIG poses a “grave threat” to U.S. financial
stability, we would be required to maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of no more
than 15:1 and the FRB may: • limit our ability to merge with, acquire, consolidate with, or become
affiliated with another company; • restrict our ability to offer specified financial products; • require us to terminate specified activities; • impose conditions on how we conduct our activities; and • with approval of the Council, and a determination that the foregoing
actions are inadequate to mitigate a threat to U.S. financial stability,
require us to sell or otherwise transfer assets or off-balance-sheet items to
unaffiliated entities. As part of its general prudential supervisory powers, the FRB
has the authority to limit our ability to conduct activities that would
otherwise be permissible for us to engage in if we do not satisfy certain
requirements. In addition, if we were to seek to acquire a stake in certain
financial companies, Dodd-Frank would require us to obtain the prior
authorization of the FRB. Other Effects
of Dodd-Frank In addition, Dodd-Frank may also have the following effects
on us: 25 TABLE OF CONTENTS Item 1 / BUSINESS • As a nonbank SIFI, we are currently required to provide on an annual
basis (or more frequently, if required) to the FRB and FDIC a plan for our rapid
and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure,
which must, among other things, provide a detailed resolution strategy and
analyses of our material entities, organizational structure, interconnections
and interdependencies, and management information systems. We continue to
update and refine our resolution plan, which was originally submitted to
regulators on July 1, 2014. Our next resolution plan is required to be
submitted to the FRB and FDIC on July 1, 2015. If the FRB and FDIC jointly
determine, based on their review of the plan, that it is not credible or would
not facilitate our orderly resolution under the bankruptcy code, they may
require us to re-submit an amended plan. If the re-submitted plan also fails
to meet regulatory expectations, the FRB and FDIC may exercise their authority
under Dodd-Frank to impose more stringent capital, leverage, or liquidity
requirements, restrict our growth, activities, or operations, require us to
divest assets and operations, or otherwise increase their level of supervision
of us. • The Council may recommend that state insurance regulators or other
regulators apply new or heightened standards and safeguards for activities or
practices that we and other insurers or other financial services companies
engage in. • Title II of Dodd-Frank provides that a financial company whose largest
United States subsidiary is an insurer (such as us) may be subject to a special
resolution process outside the federal bankruptcy code. That process is to be administered
by the FDIC upon a coordinated determination by the director of the Federal
Insurance Office and the FRB, either at the request of the Secretary of the
Treasury or on their own initiative, and in consultation with the FDIC, that
such a financial company is in default or in danger of default and presents a
systemic risk to U.S. financial stability. • Dodd-Frank provides for significantly increased regulation of and
restrictions on derivatives markets and transactions that could affect various
activities of AIG and its insurance and financial services subsidiaries,
including (i) regulatory reporting for swaps (which are regulated by the CFTC)
and security-based swaps (which are regulated by the SEC), (ii) mandated
clearing through central counterparties and execution through regulated
exchanges or electronic facilities for certain swaps and security-based swaps
and (iii) margin and collateral requirements. Although the CFTC has not yet
finalized certain requirements, many other requirements have taken effect, such
as swap reporting, the mandatory clearing of certain interest rate swaps and
credit default swaps, and the mandatory trading of certain swaps on swap
execution facilities or exchanges. The SEC has proposed, but not yet finalized,
rules with respect to certain of the regulations and restrictions noted above governing
security-based swaps. These regulations have affected and may further affect
various activities of AIG and its insurance and financial services subsidiaries
as rules are finalized to implement additional elements of the regulatory
regime. Similar regulations have been
proposed or adopted outside the United States. For instance, the EU has also
established a set of new regulatory requirements for EU derivatives activities
under EMIR. These requirements include, among other things, various risk
mitigation, risk management and regulatory reporting requirements that have
already become effective and clearing requirements that are expected to become
effective in 2015. These requirements could result in increased administrative
costs with respect to our EU derivatives activities and overlapping or
inconsistent regulation depending on the ultimate application of cross-border
regulatory requirements between and among U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions. • Dodd-Frank mandated a study to determine whether stable value contracts
should be included in the definition of "swap." If that study
concludes that stable value contracts are swaps, Dodd-Frank authorizes certain
federal regulators to determine whether an exemption from the definition of a
swap for stable value contracts is appropriate and in the public interest.
Certain of our affiliates participate in the stable value contract business. We
cannot predict what regulations might emanate from the aforementioned study or
be promulgated applicable to this business in the future. • Dodd-Frank established a Federal Insurance Office (FIO) within the
United States Department of the Treasury (Department of the Treasury) headed by
a director appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury. While not having a
general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance, the
director of this office performs various functions with respect to insurance
(other than health insurance), including serving as a non-voting member of the
Council. On December 12, 2013, the FIO released a Dodd-Frank mandated study on
how to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the United
States. The report concluded that the uniformity and efficiency of the current
state based regulatory system could be improved and highlighted areas in which
Federal involvement is recommended. In the near-term, the FIO recommended that
the states undertake reforms regarding capital adequacy, reform of insurer
resolution practices, and marketplace regulation. • Dodd-Frank established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)
as an independent bureau within the FRB to regulate consumer financial products
and services offered primarily for personal, family or household purposes.
Insurance products and services are not within the CFPB's general jurisdiction,
although the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 26 TABLE OF CONTENTS Item 1 / BUSINESS Development
has since transferred authority to the CFPB to investigate mortgage insurance
practices. Broker-dealers and investment advisers are not subject to the CFPB's
jurisdiction when acting in their registered capacity. • Title XIV of Dodd-Frank also restricts certain terms for mortgage loans,
such as loan fees, prepayment fees and other charges, and imposes certain duties
on a lender to ensure that a borrower can afford to repay the loan. Dodd-Frank imposes various assessments on financial
companies, including, as applicable to us, fees for our supervision by the FRB
and assessments to cover the costs of any special resolution of a financial
company conducted under Title II (although the regulatory authority would have
to take account of the amounts paid by us into state guaranty funds). We cannot predict whether these actions will become effective
or the effect they may have on the financial markets or on our business,
results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and credit ratings.
However, it is possible that such effect could be materially adverse. See Item
1A. Risk Factors — Regulation for additional information. Other
Regulatory Developments As described
below, AIG has been designated as a Global Systemically Important Insurer
(G-SII). In addition to the adoption of
Dodd-Frank in the United States, regulators and lawmakers around the world are continuing
to review the causes of the financial crisis and taking steps to avoid similar
problems in the future. The FSB, consisting of representatives of national
financial authorities of the G20 nations, has issued a series of frameworks and
recommendations intended to produce significant changes in how financial
companies, particularly global systemically important financial institutions,
should be regulated. These frameworks and recommendations address such issues
as financial group supervision, capital and solvency standards, systemic
economic risk, corporate governance including compensation, and a number of
related issues associated with responses to the financial crisis. The FSB has
directed the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (the IAIS,
headquartered in Basel, Switzerland) to create standards relative to these
areas and incorporate them within that body’s Insurance Core Principles (ICPs).
IAIS’s ICPs form the baseline threshold against which countries’ financial
services regulatory efforts in the insurance sector are measured. That
measurement is made by periodic Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP)
reviews conducted by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and the
reports thereon spur the development of country-specific additional or amended
regulatory changes. Lawmakers and regulatory authorities in a number of
jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries conduct business have already begun
implementing legislative and regulatory changes consistent with these recommendations,
including proposals governing consolidated regulation of insurance holding
companies by the Financial Services Agency in Japan, financial and banking
regulation adopted in France and compensation regulations proposed or adopted
by the financial regulators in Germany and the United Kingdom Prudential
Regulation Authority. The FSB has also charged the IAIS with developing a
template for measuring systemic risks posed by insurer groups. The IAIS has
requested data from selected insurers around the world to determine which
elements of the insurance sector, if any, could materially and adversely impact
other parts of the global financial services sector (e.g., commercial and
investment banking, securities trading, etc.). The IAIS has provided its assessment
template to the FSB. Based on this assessment template, on July 18, 2013, the
FSB, in consultation with the IAIS and national authorities, identified an
initial list of G-SIIs, which includes AIG. G-SIIs will be designated on an
annual basis, and AIG was redesignated as a G-SII by the FSB on November 6,
2014. The IAIS intends G-SIIs to be subject to a policy framework that
includes recovery and resolution planning requirements, enhanced group-wide
supervision, enhanced liquidity and strategic risk management planning; basic
capital requirements and higher loss absorbency (HLA) capital requirements. The
IAIS finalized its basic capital requirement (BCR) in October 2014. The BCR
covers all group activities and is required to be reported to national authorities
on a confidential basis beginning in 2015. The BCR will serve as the initial
foundation for the application of HLA capital requirements, which the IAIS
intends to be calculated in part based on engagement in non-traditional and
non-insurance activities. It is expected that the IAIS will develop HLA capital
requirements by the end of 2015 and the G-SII policy framework will be fully
implemented by 2019. The IAIS is also developing ComFrame, a Common Framework
for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups (IAIGs), which
includes additional supervisory oversight based on its ICPs but also adds
requirements and supervisory processes pertaining to the international business
activities of IAIGs. In connection with ComFrame, the IAIS is in the
process of developing a risk-based global insurance capital standard (ICS)
applicable to IAIGs. As currently delineated under ComFrame, AIG meets the
parameters set forth to define an IAIG. ComFrame requirements are
expected to be finalized in 27 TABLE OF CONTENTS Item 1 / BUSINESS 2018, and the IAIS is
conducting a field testing of ComFrame, including the ICS, ahead of that
deadline. It is expected that implementation of ComFrame and the ICS
would begin in 2019. Legislation in the European
Union could also affect our international insurance operations. The Solvency II
Directive (2009/138/EEC) (Solvency II), which was adopted on November 25, 2009
and is expected to become effective on January 1, 2016, reforms the insurance
industry’s solvency framework, including minimum capital and solvency
requirements, governance requirements, risk management and public reporting
standards. Solvency II is expected to be accompanied by Omnibus II, an EU
proposal for a directive that also contains provisions for the capital
treatment of products with long-term guarantees. Additionally, the European
Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority recently introduced interim
guidelines effective January 1, 2014 that provide regulators in EU Member
States with a framework to ensure that insurers make demonstrable progress
towards meeting Solvency II requirements in 2016. The impact on us will depend
on whether the U.S. insurance regulatory regime is deemed “equivalent” to
Solvency II; if the U.S. insurance regulatory regime is not equivalent, then
we, along with other U.S.-based insurance companies, could be required to be
supervised under Solvency II standards. Whether the U.S. insurance regulatory
regime will be deemed “equivalent” is still under consideration by European
authorities and remains uncertain, so we are not currently able to predict the
impact of Solvency II. We expect that the regulations
applicable to us and our regulated entities will continue to evolve for the
foreseeable future. Regulation of
Insurance Subsidiaries Certain states and other jurisdictions require registration
and periodic reporting by insurance companies that are licensed in such
jurisdictions and are controlled by other entities. Applicable legislation
typically requires periodic disclosure concerning the entity that controls the
registered insurer and the other companies in the holding company system and
prior approval of intercompany services and transfers of assets, including in
some instances payment of dividends by the insurance subsidiary, within the
holding company system. Our subsidiaries are registered under such legislation
in those jurisdictions that have such requirements. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and
supervision by the states and by other jurisdictions in which they do business.
Within the United States, the method of such regulation varies but generally
has its source in statutes that delegate regulatory and supervisory powers to
an insurance official. The regulation and supervision relate primarily to the
financial condition of the insurers and their corporate conduct and market
conduct activities. This includes approval of policy forms and rates, the
standards of solvency that must be met and maintained, including with respect
to risk-based capital, the licensing of insurers and their agents, the nature
of and limitations on investments, restrictions on the size of risks that may
be insured under a single policy, deposits of securities for the benefit of
policyholders, requirements for acceptability of reinsurers, periodic examinations
of the affairs of insurance companies, the form and content of reports of
financial condition required to be filed, reserves for unearned premiums,
losses and other purposes and enterprise risk management and corporate
governance requirements. In general, such regulation is for the protection of
policyholders rather than the equity owners of these companies. In the U.S., the Risk-Based Capital (RBC) formula is designed
to measure the adequacy of an insurer's statutory surplus in relation to the
risks inherent in its business. Virtually every state has adopted, in
substantial part, the RBC Model Law promulgated by the NAIC, which allows
states to act upon the results of RBC calculations, and provides for four
incremental levels of regulatory action regarding insurers whose RBC
calculations fall below specific thresholds. Those levels of action range from
the requirement to submit a plan describing how an insurer would regain a
specified RBC ratio to a mandatory regulatory takeover of the company. The RBC
formula computes a risk-adjusted surplus level by applying discrete factors to
various asset, premium and reserve items. These factors are developed to be
risk-sensitive so that higher factors are applied to items exposed to greater
risk. The statutory surplus of each of our U.S.-based Non-Life Insurance
Companies and Life Insurance Companies exceeded RBC minimum required levels as
of December 31, 2014. If any of our insurance entities fell below prescribed levels
of statutory surplus, it would be our intention to provide appropriate capital
or other types of support to that entity. For additional information, see Item
7. MD&A — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Liquidity and Capital Resources
of AIG Parent and Subsidiaries — Non-Life Insurance Companies and — Life
Insurance Companies. 28 TABLE OF CONTENTS Item 1 / BUSINESS The NAIC’s Model Regulation
“Valuation of Life Insurance Policies” (Regulation XXX) requires insurers to
establish additional statutory reserves for term life insurance policies with
long-term premium guarantees and universal life policies with secondary
guarantees (ULSGs). NAIC Actuarial Guideline 38 (Guideline AXXX) clarifies the
application of Regulation XXX as to these guarantees, including certain ULSGs.
See Item 1A – Risk Factors and Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for risks and additional information related to these statutory reserving
requirements. The NAIC has undertaken the Solvency Modernization Initiative
(SMI) which focuses on a review of insurance solvency regulations throughout
the U.S. financial regulatory system and is expected to lead to a set of
long-term solvency modernization goals. SMI is broad in scope, but the NAIC has
stated that its focus will include the U.S. solvency framework, group solvency
issues, capital requirements, international accounting and regulatory
standards, reinsurance and corporate governance. A substantial portion of our business is conducted in foreign
countries. The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions
varies. Generally, our subsidiaries operating in foreign jurisdictions must
satisfy local regulatory requirements, licenses issued by foreign authorities
to our subsidiaries are subject to modification or revocation by such
authorities, and therefore these subsidiaries could be prevented from
conducting business in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently
operate. In addition to licensing requirements, our foreign operations
are also regulated in various jurisdictions with respect to currency, policy
language and terms, advertising, amount and type of security deposits, amount
and type of reserves, amount and type of capital to be held, amount and type of
local investment and the share of profits to be returned to policyholders on
participating policies. Some foreign countries regulate rates on various types
of policies. Certain countries have established reinsurance institutions,
wholly or partially owned by the local government, to which admitted insurers
are obligated to cede a portion of their business on terms that may not always
allow foreign insurers, including our subsidiaries, full compensation. In some
countries, regulations governing constitution of technical reserves and
remittance balances may hinder remittance of profits and repatriation of
assets. See Item 7. MD&A — Liquidity and Capital Resources —

AIG involves risk. In deciding whether to invest in AIG, you should carefully
consider the following risk factors. Any of these risk factors could have a
significant or material adverse effect on our businesses, results of
operations, financial condition or liquidity. They could also cause significant
fluctuations and volatility in the trading price of our securities. Readers
should not consider any descriptions of these factors to be a complete set of
all potential risks that could affect AIG. These factors should be considered
carefully together with the other information contained in this report and the
other reports and materials filed by us with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC). Further, many of these risks are interrelated and could
occur under similar business and economic conditions, and the occurrence of
certain of them may in turn cause the emergence or exacerbate the effect of
others. Such a combination could materially increase the severity of the impact
of these risks on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition
and liquidity. MARKET
CONDITIONS Difficult conditions in the
global capital markets and the economy may materially and adversely affect our
businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our businesses are highly dependent on the economic environment, both in the
U.S. and around the world. Extreme market events, such as the global financial
crisis during 2008 and 2009, have at times led, and could in the future lead,
to a lack of liquidity, highly volatile markets, a steep depreciation in asset
values across all classes, an erosion of investor and public confidence, and a
widening of credit spreads. Concerns and events beyond our control, such as
uncertainty as to the U.S. debt ceiling, the continued funding of the U.S.
government, U.S. fiscal and monetary policy, the U.S. housing market, oil
prices and concerns about European sovereign debt risk and the European banking
industry, have in the past, and may in the future, adversely affect liquidity,
increase volatility, decrease asset prices, erode confidence and lead to wider
credit spreads. Difficult economic conditions could also result in increased
unemployment and a severe decline in business across a wide range of industries
and regions. These market and economic factors could have a material adverse
effect on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and
liquidity. Under difficult economic or market conditions, we could
experience reduced demand for our products and an elevated incidence of claims
and lapses or surrenders of policies. Contract holders may choose to defer or
cease paying insurance premiums. Other ways in which we could be negatively
affected by economic conditions include, but are not limited to: • declines in the valuation and performance of our investment portfolio,
including declines attributable to rapid increases in interest rates; • increased credit losses; • declines in the value of other assets; • impairments of goodwill and other long-lived assets; • additional statutory capital requirements; • limitations on our ability to recover deferred tax assets; • a decline in new business levels and renewals; • a decline in insured values caused by a decrease in activity at client
organizations; • an increase in liability for future policy benefits due to loss
recognition on certain long-duration insurance contracts; • higher borrowing costs and more limited availability of credit; • an increase in policy surrenders and cancellations; and • a write-off of deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC). Sustained
low interest rates may materially and adversely affect our profitability. Recent periods have been
characterized by low interest rates relative to historical levels. Sustained
low interest rates can negatively affect the performance of our investment
securities and reduce the level of investment income earned on our investment
portfolios. If a low interest rate environment persists, we may experience
slower investment income growth. Due to practical and capital markets
limitations, we may not be able to fully mitigate our interest rate risk by
matching exposure of our assets relative to our liabilities. Continued low
interest rates could also impair our ability to earn the returns assumed in the
pricing and the reserving 31 TABLE OF CONTENTS Item 1A / risk factors for our products at the time
they were sold and issued. Changes in interest rates may be correlated with
inflation trends, which would impact our loss trends. Investment
Portfolio, Concentration of Investments, Insurance and other Exposures The performance and value of our
investment portfolio are
subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in interest
rates . Our investment
securities are subject to market risks and uncertainties. In particular,
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including monetary
policies, domestic and international economic and political issues and other
factors beyond our control. Changes in monetary policy or other factors may
cause interest rates to rise, which would adversely affect the value of the
fixed income securities that we hold and could adversely affect our ability to
sell these securities. In addition, the evaluation of available-for-sale
securities for other-than-temporary impairments, which may occur if interest
rates rise, is a quantitative and qualitative process that is subject to
significant management judgment. For a sensitivity analysis of our exposure to
certain market risk factors, see Item 7. MD&A – Enterprise Risk Management
– Market Risk Management. Furthermore, our alternative investment portfolio
includes investments for which changes in fair value are reported through
operating income and are therefore subject to significant volatility. In an
economic downturn or declining market, the reduction in our investment income
due to decreases in the fair value of alternative investments could have a
material adverse effect on operating income. Our investment
portfolio is concentrated in certain segments of the economy. Our
results of operations and financial condition have in the past been, and may in
the future be, adversely affected by the degree of concentration in our
investment portfolio. We have concentrations in real estate and real
estate-related securities, including residential mortgage-backed, commercial
mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities and commercial mortgage
loans. We also have significant exposures to financial institutions and, in
particular, to money center and global banks; certain industries, such as
energy and utilities; U.S. state and local government issuers and authorities;
PICC Group, PICC P&C and AerCap, as a result of our strategic investments;
and Euro Zone financial institutions, governments and corporations. Events or
developments that have a negative effect on any particular industry, asset
class, group of related industries or geographic region may adversely affect
our investments to the extent they are concentrated in such segments. Our
ability to sell assets concentrated in such areas may be limited. Concentration
of our insurance and other risk exposures may have adverse effects. We may be exposed to risks as a result of concentrations in our insurance policies,
derivatives and other obligations that we undertake for customers and
counterparties. We manage these concentration risks by monitoring the
accumulation of our exposures by factors such as exposure type, industry,
geographic region, counterparty and other factors. We also seek to use
reinsurance, hedging and other arrangements to limit or offset exposures that
exceed the limits we wish to retain. In certain circumstances, however, these
risk management arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms or may
prove to be ineffective for certain exposures. Also, our exposure may be so
large that even a slightly adverse experience compared to our expectations may
have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or
financial condition, or result in additional statutory capital requirements for
our subsidiaries. Our valuation of investment
securities may include methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are
subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment
valuations that may materially adversely affect our results of operations,
financial condition and liquidity. During
periods of market disruption, it may be difficult to value certain of our
investment securities if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data
becomes less observable. There may be cases where certain assets in normally
active markets with significant observable data become inactive with
insufficient observable data due to the financial environment or market
conditions in effect at that time. As a result, valuations may include inputs
and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation and
judgment as well as valuation methods that are more complex. These values may
not be realized in a market transaction, may not reflect the value of the asset
and may change very rapidly as market conditions change and valuation
assumptions are modified. Decreases in value and/or an inability to realize
that value in a market transaction or secured lending transaction may have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and
liquidity. 32 TABLE OF CONTENTS Item 1A / risk factors Reserves and Exposures Our consolidated results of
operations, liquidity, financial condition and ratings are subject to the
effects of natural and man-made catastrophic events. Events such
as hurricanes, windstorms, flooding, earthquakes, acts of terrorism, explosions
and fires, cyber-crimes, product defects, pandemic and other highly contagious
diseases, mass torts and other catastrophes have adversely affected our
business in the past and could do so in the future. In addition, we recognize
the scientific consensus that climate change is a reality of increasing
concern, indicated by higher concentrations of greenhouse gases, a warming
atmosphere and ocean, diminished snow and ice, and sea level rise. We
understand that climate change potentially poses a serious financial threat to
society as a whole, with implications for the insurance industry in areas such
as catastrophe risk perception, pricing and modeling assumptions. Because there
is significant variability associated with the impacts of climate change, we
cannot predict how physical, legal, regulatory and social responses may impact
our business. Such catastrophic events, and any relevant regulations, could
expose us to: • widespread claim costs associated with property, workers’ compensation,
A&H, business interruption and mortality and morbidity claims; • loss resulting from a decline in the value of our invested assets; • limitations on our ability to recover deferred tax assets; • loss resulting from actual policy experience that is adverse compared to
the assumptions made in product pricing; • declines in value and/or losses with respect to companies and other
entities whose securities we hold and counterparties we transact business with
and have credit exposure to, including reinsurers, and declines in the value of
investments; and • significant interruptions to our systems and operations. Catastrophic events are generally unpredictable. Our
exposure to catastrophes depends on various factors, including the frequency
and severity of the catastrophes, the rate of inflation and the value and
geographic concentration of insured property and people. Vendor models and
proprietary assumptions and processes that we use to manage catastrophe
exposure may prove to be ineffective due to incorrect assumptions or
estimates. In addition, legislative and regulatory initiatives and
court decisions following major catastrophes could require us to pay the
insured beyond the provisions of the original insurance policy and may prohibit
the application of a deductible, resulting in inflated catastrophe claims. For further details on potential catastrophic events,
including a sensitivity analysis of our exposure to certain catastrophes, see
Item 7. MD&A — Enterprise Risk Management —Insurance
Operations Risks. Insurance
liabilities are difficult to predict and may exceed the related reserves for
losses and loss expenses. We regularly review the adequacy of the
established liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and
conduct extensive analyses of our reserves during the year. Our loss reserves,
however, may develop adversely. Estimation of ultimate net losses, loss
expenses and loss reserves is a complex process, particularly for long-tail
casualty lines of business. These include, but are not limited to, general
liability, commercial automobile liability, environmental, workers'
compensation, excess casualty and crisis management coverages, insurance and
risk management programs for large corporate customers and other customized
structured insurance products, as well as excess and umbrella liability,
Directors and Officers and products liability. While we use a number of analytical reserve development
techniques to project future loss development, reserves may be significantly
affected by changes in loss cost trends or loss development factors that were
relied upon in setting the reserves. These changes in loss cost trends or loss development
factors could be due to difficulties in predicting changes, such as changes in
inflation, unemployment duration, or other social or economic factors affecting
claims, including the judicial environment. Any deviation in loss cost trends
or in loss development factors might not be identified for an extended period
of time after we record the initial loss reserve estimates for any accident
year or number of years. For a further discussion of our loss reserves, see
Item 7. MD&A — Insurance Reserves —Non-Life Insurance
Companies and Critical Accounting Estimates — Insurance Liabilities —
Liability for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses (Non-Life Insurance
Companies). 33 TABLE OF CONTENTS Item 1A / risk factors Reinsurance may not be available or affordable and may not
be adequate to protect us against losses. Our subsidiaries are
major purchasers of reinsurance and we use reinsurance as part of our overall
risk management strategy to optimize the allocation of our reinsurance between
traditional reinsurance markets and the capital markets, such as through the
utilization of catastrophe bonds, to manage risks more efficiently. While
reinsurance does not discharge our subsidiaries from their obligation to pay
claims for losses insured under our policies, it does make the reinsurer liable
to them for the reinsured portion of the risk. For this reason, reinsurance is
an important tool to manage transaction and insurance line risk retention and
to mitigate losses from catastrophes. Market conditions beyond our control
determine the availability and cost of reinsurance. For example, reinsurance
may be more difficult or costly to obtain after a year with a large number of
major catastrophes. As a result, we may, at certain times, be forced to incur
additional expenses for reinsurance or may be unable to obtain sufficient
reinsurance on acceptable terms. In that case, we would have to accept an
increase in exposure risk, reduce the amount of business written by our
subsidiaries or seek alternatives in line with our risk limits. Additionally,
we are exposed to credit risk with respect to our subsidiaries’ reinsurers to
the extent the reinsurance receivable is not secured by collateral or does not
benefit from other credit enhancements. We also bear the risk that a reinsurer
may be unwilling to pay amounts we have recorded as reinsurance recoverable for
any reason, including that (i) the terms of the reinsurance contract do not
reflect the intent of the parties of the contract, (ii) the terms of the
contract cannot be legally enforced, (iii) the terms of the contract are
interpreted by a court or arbitration panel differently than intended, (iv) the
reinsurance transaction performs differently than we anticipated due to a
flawed design of the reinsurance structure, terms or conditions, or (v) a
change in laws and regulations, or in the interpretation of the laws and
regulations, materially impacts a reinsurance transaction. The insolvency
of one or more of our reinsurers, or inability or unwillingness to make timely
payments under the terms of our contracts, could have a material adverse effect
on our results of operations and liquidity. Additionally, the use of
catastrophe bonds may not provide the same levels of protection as traditional
reinsurance transactions and any disruption, volatility and uncertainty in the
catastrophe bond market, such as following a major catastrophe event, may limit
our ability to access such market on terms favorable to us or at all. Also, to
the extent that we intend to utilize catastrophe bond transactions based on an
industry loss index rather than on actual losses incurred by us, this would
result in residual risk. Our inability to obtain adequate reinsurance or other
protection could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition. We currently have limited reinsurance coverage for terrorist
attacks. Further, the availability of private sector reinsurance for terrorism
is limited. As a result, we rely heavily on the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act
(TRIA), which provides U.S. government risk assistance to the insurance
industry to manage the exposure to terrorism incidents in the United States.
TRIA was reauthorized in January 2015 and is scheduled to expire on December
31, 2020. Under TRIA, once our losses for certain acts of terrorism exceed a
deductible equal to 20 percent of our commercial property and casualty
insurance premiums for covered lines for the prior calendar year, the federal
government will reimburse us for losses in excess of our deductible, starting
at 85 percent of losses in 2015, and reducing by one percentage point each
year, ending at 80 percent in 2020, up to a total industry program limit of
$100 billion. TRIA does not cover losses in certain lines of business such as
consumer property and consumer casualty. For additional information on our reinsurance recoverable,
see Item 7. MD&A — Enterprise Risk Management — Insurance
Operations Risks — Reinsurance Recoverable. LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL AND CREDIT AIG
Parent’s ability to access funds from our subsidiaries is limited. As a holding company, AIG Parent depends on dividends, distributions and other
payments from its subsidiaries to fund dividends on AIG Common Stock and to
make payments due on its obligations, including its outstanding debt. The
majority of our investments are held by our regulated subsidiaries. Our
subsidiaries may be limited in their ability to make dividend payments or
advance funds to AIG Parent in the future because of the need to support their
own capital levels or because of regulatory limits. The inability of our
subsidiaries to make payments, dividends or distributions in an amount
sufficient to enable AIG Parent to meet its cash requirements could have an
adverse effect on our operations, our ability to pay dividends or our ability
to meet our debt service obligations. Our internal sources of liquidity
may be insufficient to meet our needs. We need liquidity to pay
our operating expenses, interest on our debt, maturing debt obligations and to
meet any statutory capital requirements of our subsidiaries. If our liquidity
is insufficient to meet our needs, we may at the time need to have recourse to
third-party financing, external capital markets or other sources of liquidity,
which may not be available or could be prohibitively expensive. The
availability and cost of any additional financing at any given time depends on
a variety of factors, including general market conditions, the volume of
trading activities, the overall availability of credit, regulatory actions and
our credit ratings and credit capacity. It is also possible 34 TABLE OF CONTENTS Item 1A / risk factors that,
as a result of such recourse to external financing, customers, lenders or
investors could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term
financial prospects. Disruptions, volatility and uncertainty in the financial
markets, and downgrades in our credit ratings, may limit our ability to access
external capital markets at times and on terms favorable to us to meet our
capital and liquidity needs or prevent our accessing the external capital
markets or other financing sources. For a further discussion of our liquidity,
see Item 7. MD&A — Liquidity and Capital Resources. AIG
Parent’s ability to support our subsidiaries is limited. AIG Parent has in the past and expects to continue
to provide capital to our subsidiaries as necessary to maintain regulatory
capital ratios, comply with rating agency requirements and meet unexpected cash
flow obligations. If AIG Parent is unable to satisfy a capital need of a
subsidiary, the subsidiary could become insolvent or, in certain cases, could
be seized by its regulator. Our
subsidiaries may not be able to generate cash to meet their needs due to the
illiquidity of some of their investments. Our subsidiaries have
investments in certain securities that may be illiquid, including certain fixed
income securities and certain structured securities, private company
securities, investments in private equity funds and hedge funds, mortgage
loans, finance receivables and real estate. Collectively, investments in these
assets had a fair value of $60 billion at December 31, 2014. Adverse
real estate and capital markets, and tighter credit spreads, have in the past,
and may in the future, materially adversely affect the liquidity of our other
securities portfolios, including our residential and commercial mortgage‑related
securities portfolios. In the event additional liquidity is required by one or
more of our subsidiaries and AIG Parent is unable to provide it, it may be
difficult for these subsidiaries to generate additional liquidity by selling,
pledging or otherwise monetizing these less liquid investments. A
downgrade in the Insurer Financial Strength ratings of our insurance companies
could prevent them from writing new business and retaining customers and
business. Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) ratings are an
important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance
companies. IFS ratings measure an insurance company’s ability to meet its
obligations to contract holders and policyholders. High ratings help maintain public
confidence in a company’s products, facilitate marketing of products and
enhance its competitive position. Downgrades of the IFS ratings of our
insurance companies could prevent these companies from selling, or make it more
difficult for them to succeed in selling, products and services, or result in
increased policy cancellations, termination of assumed reinsurance contracts,
or return of premiums. Under credit rating agency policies concerning the
relationship between parent and subsidiary ratings, a downgrade in AIG Parent’s
credit ratings could result in a downgrade of the IFS ratings of our insurance
subsidiaries. A
downgrade in our credit ratings could require us to post additional collateral
and result in the termination of derivative transactions. Credit
ratings estimate a company’s ability to meet its obligations and may directly
affect the cost and availability of financing. A downgrade of our long-term
debt ratings by the major rating agencies would require us to post additional
collateral payments related to derivative transactions to which we are a party,
and could permit the termination of these derivative transactions. This could
adversely affect our business, our consolidated results of operations in a
reporting period or our liquidity. In the event of further downgrades of two
notches to our long-term senior debt ratings, AIG would be required to post
additional collateral of $153 million, and certain of our counterparties would
be permitted to elect early termination of contracts. Business and operations Interest
rate fluctuations, increased surrenders, declining investment returns and other
events may require our subsidiaries to accelerate the amortization of DAC and
record additional liabilities for future policy benefits. We incur significant
costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance business. DAC
represents deferred costs that are incremental and directly related to the
successful acquisition of new business or renewal of existing business. The
recovery of DAC is generally dependent upon the future profitability of the
related business, but DAC amortization varies based on the type of contract.
For long-duration traditional business, DAC is generally amortized in
proportion to premium revenue and varies with lapse experience. Actual lapses
in excess of expectations can result in an acceleration of DAC amortization. DAC for investment-oriented products is generally amortized
in proportion to estimated gross profits. Estimated gross profits are affected
by a number of assumptions, including current and expected interest rates, net
investment income and spreads, net realized gains and losses, fees, surrender
rates, mortality experience and equity market returns and volatility. If
actual and/or future estimated gross profits are less than originally expected,
then the amortization of DAC would be accelerated in the period the actual
experience is known and would result in a charge to income. For example, if
interest rates rise rapidly 35 TABLE OF CONTENTS Item 1A / risk factors and significantly,
customers with policies that have interest crediting rates below the current
market may seek competing products with higher returns and we may experience an
increase in surrenders and withdrawals of life and annuity contracts, resulting
in a decrease in future profitability and an acceleration of the amortization
of DAC. We also periodically review products for potential loss
recognition events, principally insurance-oriented products. This review
involves estimating the future profitability of in-force business and requires
significant management judgment about assumptions including mortality,
morbidity, persistency, maintenance expenses, and investment returns, including
net realized capital gains (losses). If actual experience or estimates result
in projected future losses, we may be required to amortize any remaining DAC
and record additional liabilities through a charge to policyholder benefit
expense, which could negatively affect our results of operations. For example,
realized gains on investment sales in 2013 and 2012 reduced future investment
margins and required the recognition of additional liabilities for certain
payout annuities. For further discussion of DAC and future policy benefits,
see Item 7. MD&A — Critical Accounting Estimates and Notes 9 and 13 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our products have guarantees that may increase
the volatility of our results. We have annuity and life insurance products
that guarantee a certain level of benefits, including guaranteed minimum death
benefits (GMDB), guaranteed minimum income benefits (GMIB), guaranteed minimum
withdrawal benefits (GMWB), guaranteed minimum account value benefits (GMAV),
and products with guaranteed interest crediting rates tied to an index. For
GMDB, our most widely offered guaranteed benefit feature, the liabilities
included in Future policyholder benefits were $401 million and $355 million at
December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our economic hedging program utilizes
derivative instruments, including equity options, futures contracts and
interest rate swap contracts, as well as other hedging instruments, and is
designed so that changes in value of those instruments move in the opposite
direction of changes in the GMWB and GMAV embedded derivative liabilities. The
fair value of GMWB and GMAV embedded derivatives included in Policyholder
contract deposits was a net liability of $957 million at December 31, 2014 and
a net asset of $37 million at December 31, 2013. Differences between the change
in fair value of GMWB and GMAV embedded derivatives and the hedging instruments
can be caused by extreme and unanticipated movements in the equity markets,
interest rates and market volatility, policyholder behavior and our inability
to purchase hedging instruments at prices consistent with the desired risk and
return trade-off. While we believe that our actions have reduced the
risks related to guaranteed benefits and guaranteed interest crediting, our
exposure may not be fully hedged, and we may be liable if counterparties are
unable or unwilling to pay. We remain exposed to the risk that policyholder
behavior and mortality may differ from our assumptions. Finally, while we
believe the impact of downturns in equity markets, increased equity volatility
or reduced interest rates is offset by our economic hedging program, the
occurrence of one or more of these events could result in an increase in the
liabilities associated with the guaranteed benefits, reducing our net income
and shareholders’ equity. See Notes 5 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements and Item 7. MD&A – Critical Accounting Estimates for more
information regarding these products. Indemnity
claims could be made against us in connection with divested businesses. We have provided financial guarantees and indemnities in connection with the
businesses we have sold, as described in greater detail in Note 16 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. While we do not currently believe the claims
under these indemnities will be material, it is possible that significant
indemnity claims could be made against us. If such a claim or claims were
successful, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations, cash flows and liquidity. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for more information on these financial guarantees and indemnities. Our
foreign operations expose us to risks that may affect our operations. We provide insurance, investment and other financial products and services to
both businesses and individuals in more than 100 countries and jurisdictions. A
substantial portion of our business is conducted outside the United States, and
we intend to continue to grow this business. Operations outside the United
States may be affected by regional economic downturns, changes in foreign
currency exchange rates, political upheaval, nationalization and other
restrictive government actions, which could also affect our other operations. The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign
jurisdictions varies. AIG subsidiaries operating in foreign jurisdictions must
satisfy local regulatory requirements and it is possible that local licenses
may require AIG Parent to meet certain conditions. Licenses issued by foreign
authorities to our subsidiaries are subject to modification and revocation.
Consequently, our insurance subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting
future business in some of the jurisdictions where they currently operate.
Adverse actions from any single country could adversely affect our results of
operations, depending on the magnitude of the event and our financial exposure
at that time in that country. 36 TABLE OF CONTENTS Item 1A / risk factors We may experience difficulty in marketing and
distributing products through our current and future distribution channels. Although we distribute our products through a wide variety of distribution
channels, we maintain relationships with certain key distributors. Distributors
have in the past, and may in the future, elect to renegotiate the terms of existing
relationships, or reduce or terminate their distribution relationships with us,
including for such reasons as industry consolidation of distributors or other
industry changes that increase the competition for access to distributors,
adverse developments in our business, adverse rating agency actions or concerns
about market-related risks. An interruption in certain key relationships could
materially affect our ability to market our products and could have a material
adverse effect on our businesses, operating results and financial condition. In addition, when our products are distributed through
unaffiliated firms, we may not be able to monitor or control the manner of
their distribution, despite our training and compliance programs. If our
products are distributed to customers for whom they are unsuitable or
distributed in any other inappropriate manner, we may suffer reputational and
other harm to our business. Our ownership of a material amount of the common stock
of, and our obligations to, AerCap exposes us to risks. As a result of the
AerCap Transaction, we hold approximately 46 percent of the outstanding common
stock of AerCap. As a result, declines in the value of AerCap’s common stock,
and the other effects of our accounting for this investment under the equity
method of accounting, could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations in a reporting period. In addition, in connection with the AerCap Transaction, AIG,
AerCap, AerCap Ireland Limited, AerCap Ireland Capital Limited (AerCap Ireland)
and certain subsidiaries of AerCap, as guarantors, entered into a credit
agreement for a senior unsecured revolving credit facility between AerCap
Ireland, as borrower, and AIG, as lender and administrative agent (the AerCap
Credit Facility). The AerCap Credit Facility provides for an aggregate
commitment of $1.0 billion and permits loans for general corporate purposes.
Depending on the amount of outstanding borrowings under the AerCap Credit
Facility, an event of default under the AerCap Credit Facility could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Significant
legal proceedings may adversely affect our results of operations or financial
condition. We are party to numerous legal proceedings, including
securities class actions and regulatory and governmental investigations. Due to
the nature of these proceedings, the lack of precise damage claims and the type
of claims we are subject to, we cannot currently quantify our ultimate or
maximum liability for these actions. Developments in these unresolved matters
could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or
consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period. Starr
International Company, Inc. (SICO) has brought suit against the United States
challenging the government’s assistance of AIG, pursuant to which (i) AIG
entered into a credit facility with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and
(ii) the United States received an approximately 80 percent ownership interest
in AIG. The United States has alleged that AIG is obligated to indemnify
the United States for any recoveries in these lawsuits. A determination
that the United States is liable for damages in such suits, together with a
determination that AIG is obligated to indemnify the United States for any such
damages, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated
financial condition and results of operations. For
a discussion of the SICO litigation and other unresolved matters, see Note 16
to the Consolidated Financial Statements. If we are unable to maintain
the availability of our electronic data systems and safeguard the security of
our data, our ability to conduct business may be compromised, which could
adversely affect our consolidated financial condition or results of operations . We
use computer systems to store, retrieve, evaluate and utilize customer,
employee, and company data and information. Some of these systems in turn, rely
upon third-party systems. Our business is highly dependent on our ability to
access these systems to perform necessary business functions, including
providing insurance quotes, processing premium payments, making changes to
existing policies, filing and paying claims, administering variable annuity
products and mutual funds, providing customer support and managing our
investment portfolios. Systems failures or outages could compromise our ability
to perform these functions in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to
conduct business and hurt our relationships with our business partners and
customers. In the event of a natural disaster, a computer virus, unauthorized
access, a terrorist attack or other disruption inside or outside the U.S., our
systems may be inaccessible to our employees, customers or business partners
for an extended period of time, and our employees may be unable to perform
their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems are disabled
or destroyed. Our systems have in the past been, and may in the future be,
subject to unauthorized access, such as physical or electronic break-ins or
unauthorized tampering. Like other global companies, we have, from time to
time, experienced threats to our data and systems, including malware and
computer virus attacks, unauthorized access, systems failures and disruptions.
There is no assurance that our security measures will provide fully effective
security from such events. AIG maintains cyber risk insurance, but this insurance
may not cover all costs associated with the consequences of personal,
confidential or proprietary information being compromised. In 37 TABLE OF CONTENTS Item 1A / risk factors some cases, such unauthorized access may not be
immediately detected. This may impede or interrupt our business operations and
could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition or results of
operations. In addition, we routinely transmit, receive
and store personal, confidential and proprietary information by email and other
electronic means. Although we attempt to keep such information confidential, we
may be unable to do so in all events, especially with clients, vendors, service
providers, counterparties and other third parties who may not have
or use appropriate controls to protect confidential information. Furthermore,
certain of our businesses are subject to compliance with laws and regulations
enacted by U.S. federal and state governments, the European Union or other
jurisdictions or enacted by various regulatory organizations or exchanges
relating to the privacy and security of the information of clients, employees
or others. The compromise of personal, confidential or proprietary information
could result in remediation costs, legal liability, regulatory action and
reputational harm. The integration of companies we may acquire
from time to time may not be as successful as we anticipate. Acquisitions involve a number of risks, including
operational, strategic, financial, accounting, legal and tax. Difficulties in
integrating an acquired company may result in the acquired company performing
differently than we expected or in our failure to realize anticipated
expense-related efficiencies. Our existing businesses could also be negatively
impacted by acquisitions. Risks resulting from future acquisitions may have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. REGULATION Our businesses are heavily
regulated and changes in regulation may affect our operations, increase our
insurance subsidiary capital requirements or reduce our profitability. Our operations generally, and our insurance subsidiaries, in particular, are
subject to extensive and potentially conflicting supervision and regulation by
national authorities and by the various jurisdictions in which we do business.
Supervision and regulation relate to numerous aspects of our business and
financial condition. State and foreign regulators also periodically review and
investigate our insurance businesses, including AIG-specific and industry-wide
practices. The primary purpose of insurance regulation is the protection of our
insurance contract holders, and not our investors. The extent of domestic
regulation varies, but generally is governed by state statutes. These statutes
delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative authority to state
insurance departments. We strive to maintain all required licenses and approvals.
However, our businesses may not fully comply with the wide variety of
applicable laws and regulations. The relevant authority’s interpretation of the
laws and regulations also may change from time to time. Regulatory authorities
have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew or revoke licenses and
approvals. If we do not have the required licenses and approvals or do not
comply with applicable regulatory requirements, these authorities could
preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our
activities or impose substantial fines. Further, insurance regulatory
authorities have relatively broad discretion to issue orders of supervision,
which permit them to supervise the business and operations of an insurance
company. In the U.S., the RBC formula is designed to measure the
adequacy of an insurer’s statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in
its business. Virtually every state has adopted, in substantial part, the RBC
Model Law promulgated by the NAIC, which specifies the regulatory actions the
insurance regulator may take if an insurer’s RBC calculations fall below
specific thresholds. Those actions range from requiring an insurer to submit a
plan describing how it would regain a specified RBC ratio to a mandatory
regulatory takeover of the company. Regulators at the federal and international
levels are also considering the imposition of additional capital requirements on
certain insurance companies, which may include us, that may augment or even
displace state-law RBC standards that apply at the legal entity level, and such
capital calculations may be made on bases other than the statutory statements
of our insurance subsidiaries. See “Our status as a nonbank systemically
important financial institution, as well as the enactment of Dodd-Frank, will
subject us to substantial additional federal regulation, which may materially
and adversely affect our businesses, results of operations and cash flows” and
“Actions by foreign governments and regulators could subject us to substantial
additional regulation” below for additional information on increased capital
requirements that may be imposed on us. We cannot predict the effect these
initiatives may have on our business, results of operations, cash flows and
financial condition. The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign
jurisdictions varies. AIG subsidiaries operating in foreign jurisdictions must
satisfy local regulatory requirements and it is possible that local licenses
may require AIG Parent to meet certain conditions. Licenses issued by foreign
authorities to our subsidiaries are subject to modification and revocation.
Accordingly, our insurance 38 TABLE OF CONTENTS Item 1A / risk factors subsidiaries could be
prevented from conducting future business in certain of the jurisdictions where
they currently operate. Adverse actions from any single country could adversely
affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, depending
on the magnitude of the event and our financial exposure at that time in that
country. See Item 1. Business – Regulation for further discussion of
our regulatory environment. Our
status as a nonbank systemically important financial institution, as well as
the enactment of Dodd-Frank, will subject us to substantial additional federal
regulation, which may materially and adversely affect our businesses, results
of operations and cash flows. On July 21, 2010,
Dodd-Frank, which effects comprehensive changes to the regulation of financial
services in the United States, was signed into law. Dodd-Frank directs existing
and newly created government agencies and bodies to promulgate regulations
implementing the law, an ongoing process anticipated to continue over the next
few years. We cannot predict the requirements of the regulations
ultimately adopted, the level and magnitude of supervision we may become
subject to, or how Dodd-Frank and such regulations will affect the financial
markets generally or our businesses, results of operations or cash flows. It is
possible that the regulations adopted under Dodd-Frank and our regulation by
the FRB as a nonbank SIFI could significantly alter our business practices,
limit our ability to engage in capital or liability management, require us to
raise additional capital, and impose burdensome and costly requirements and
additional costs. Some of the regulations may also affect the perceptions of
regulators, customers, counterparties, creditors or investors about our
financial strength and could potentially affect our financing costs. See Item 1. Business – Regulation for further discussion of
the details of the aforementioned regulations to which AIG and its businesses
are subject. Actions by foreign governments and regulators could
subject us to substantial additional regulation. We
cannot predict the impact laws and regulations adopted in foreign jurisdictions
may have on the financial markets generally or our businesses, results of
operations or cash flows. It is possible such laws and regulations, the impact
of our designation as a global systemically important insurer (G-SII) and
certain initiatives by the FSB and the IAIS, including development of Basic
Capital Requirements, Higher Loss Absorbency Capacity Requirements and an Insurance
Capital Standard, and implementation of Solvency II in the European Union, may
significantly alter our business practices, limit our ability to engage in
capital or liability management, require us to raise additional capital, and
impose burdensome requirements and additional costs. It is possible that the
laws and regulations adopted in foreign jurisdictions will differ from one
another and that they could be inconsistent with the laws and regulations of
other jurisdictions including the United States. For further details on these international regulations and
their potential impact on AIG and its businesses, see Item 1. Business –
Regulation—Other Regulatory Developments. The USA
PATRIOT Act, the Office of Foreign Assets Control and similar laws that apply
to us may expose us to significant penalties. The operations of
our subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations, including, in some cases,
the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, which require companies to know certain
information about their clients and to monitor their transactions for
suspicious activities. Also, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign
Assets Control administers regulations requiring U.S. persons to refrain from
doing business, or allowing their clients to do business through them, with
certain organizations or individuals on a prohibited list maintained by the
U.S. government or with certain countries. The United Kingdom, the European
Union and other jurisdictions maintain similar laws and regulations. Although
we have instituted compliance programs to address these requirements, there are
inherent risks in global transactions. Attempts
to efficiently manage the impact of Regulation XXX and Actuarial Guideline
AXXX may fail in whole or in part resulting in an adverse effect on our
financial condition and results of operations. The NAIC Model Regulation “Valuation of Life Insurance
Policies” (Regulation XXX) requires insurers to establish additional statutory
reserves for term life insurance policies with long-term premium guarantees and
universal life policies with secondary guarantees. In addition, NAIC Actuarial Guideline 38 (AXXX) (Guideline AXXX) clarifies the application of
Regulation XXX as to certain universal life insurance policies with secondary
guarantees. Our domestic Life Insurance Companies manage the capital
impact of statutory reserve requirements under Regulation XXX and Guideline
AXXX through affiliated reinsurance transactions, to maintain their ability to
offer competitive pricing and successfully market such products. See Note 20 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on 39 TABLE OF CONTENTS Item 1A / risk factors statutory reserving requirements under Regulation XXX and
Guideline AXXX and our use of affiliated reinsurance. The NAIC, the New York
State Department of Financial Services and other regulators have increased
their focus on life insurers’ affiliated reinsurance transactions used to
satisfy certain reserve requirements or to manage the capital impact of certain
statutory reserve requirements, particularly transactions using captive
insurance companies or special purpose vehicles. While our domestic Life
Insurance Companies do not use captive or special purpose vehicle structures
for this purpose, we cannot predict whether any applicable insurance laws will
be changed in a way that prohibits or adversely impacts the use of affiliated
reinsurance. If regulations change, we could be required to increase statutory
reserves, increase prices on our products or incur higher expenses to obtain
reinsurance, which could adversely affect our competitive position, financial
condition or results of operations. If our actions to efficiently manage the
impact of Regulation XXX or Guideline AXXX on future sales of term and
universal life insurance products are not successful, we may incur higher
operating costs or our sales of these products may be affected. New
regulations promulgated from time to time may affect our businesses, results of
operations, financial condition and ability to compete effectively. Legislators and regulators may periodically consider various proposals that may
affect the profitability of certain of our businesses. New regulations may even
affect our ability to conduct certain businesses at all, including proposals
relating to restrictions on the type of activities in which financial
institutions are permitted to engage and the size of financial institutions.
These proposals could also impose additional taxes on a limited subset of
financial institutions and insurance companies (either based on size,
activities, geography, government support or other criteria). It is uncertain
whether and how these and other such proposals would apply to us or our
competitors or how they could impact our consolidated results of operations,
financial condition and ability to compete effectively. An
“ownership change” could limit our ability to utilize tax loss and credit
carryforwards to offset future taxable income. As of December 31,
2014, we had a U.S. federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately
$33.0 billion and $7.1 billion in foreign tax credits (tax loss and credit
carryforwards). Our ability to use such tax attributes to offset future taxable
income may be significantly limited if we experience an “ownership change” as
defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
Code). In general, an ownership change will occur when the percentage of AIG
Parent's ownership (by value) of one or more “5-percent shareholders” (as
defined in the Code) has increased by more than 50 percent over the lowest
percentage owned by such shareholders at any time during the prior three years
(calculated on a rolling basis). An entity that experiences an ownership change
generally will be subject to an annual limitation on its pre-ownership change
tax loss and credit carryforwards equal to the equity value of the corporation
immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term,
tax-exempt rate posted monthly by the IRS (subject to certain adjustments). The
annual limitation would be increased each year to the extent that there is an
unused limitation in a prior year. The limitation on our ability to utilize tax
loss and credit carryforwards arising from an ownership change under Section
382 would depend on the value of our equity at the time of any ownership
change. If we were to experience an “ownership change”, it is possible that a
significant portion of our tax loss and credit carryforwards could expire
before we would be able to use them to offset future taxable income. On March 9, 2011, our Board adopted our Tax Asset Protection
Plan (the Plan) to help protect these tax loss and credit carryforwards, and on
January 8, 2014, the Board adopted an amendment to the Plan, extending its
expiration date to January 8, 2017. The amendment of the Plan was ratified by
our shareholders at our 2014 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. At our 2011
Annual Meeting of Shareholders, shareholders adopted a protective amendment to
our Restated Certificate of Incorporation (Protective Amendment), which is
designed to prevent certain transfers of AIG Common Stock that could result in
an “ownership change.” At our 2014 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, our
shareholders approved an amendment to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation
to adopt a successor to the Protective Amendment that contains substantially
the same terms as the Protective Amendment and that expires on May 12, 2017,
the third anniversary of the date of our 2014 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The Plan is designed to reduce the likelihood of an
“ownership change” by (i) discouraging any person or group from becoming a 4.99
percent shareholder and (ii) discouraging any existing 4.99 percent shareholder
from acquiring additional shares of AIG Common Stock. The Protective Amendment
generally restricts any transfer of AIG Common Stock that would (i) increase
the ownership by any person to 4.99 percent or more of AIG stock then
outstanding or (ii) increase the percentage of AIG stock owned by a Five
Percent Stockholder (as defined in the Plan). Despite the intentions of the
Plan and the Protective Amendment to deter and prevent an “ownership change”,
such an event may still occur. In addition, the Plan and the Protective
Amendment may make it more difficult and more expensive to acquire us, and may
discourage open market purchases of AIG Common Stock or a non-negotiated tender
or exchange offer for AIG Common Stock. Accordingly, the Plan 40 TABLE OF CONTENTS Item 1A / risk factors and the Protective Amendment may limit a shareholder’s
ability to realize a premium over the market price of AIG Common Stock in
connection with any stock transaction. Changes
in tax laws could increase our corporate taxes, reduce our deferred tax assets
or make some of our products less attractive to consumers. Changes
in tax laws or their interpretation could negatively impact our business or
results. Some proposed changes could have the effect of increasing our
effective tax rate by reducing deductions or increasing income inclusions, such
as by limiting rules allowing deferral of tax on certain foreign insurance
income. Conversely, other changes, such as lowering the U.S. federal corporate
tax rate discussed recently in the context of tax reform, could reduce the
value of our deferred tax assets. In addition, changes in the way foreign taxes
can be credited against U.S. taxes, methods for allocating interest expense,
the ways insurance companies calculate and deduct reserves for tax purposes,
and impositions of new or changed premium, value added and other indirect taxes
could increase our tax expense, thereby reducing earnings. In addition to proposing to change the taxation of
corporations in general and insurance companies in particular, the Executive
Branch of the U.S. Government and Congress have considered proposals that could
increase taxes on owners of insurance products. For example, there have been
proposals that would have limited the deferral of tax on income from life and
annuity contracts relative to other investment products. These changes could
reduce demand in the U.S. for life insurance and annuity contracts, or cause
consumers to shift from these contracts to other investments, which would
reduce our income due to lower sales of these products or potential increased
surrenders of in-force business. The need for governments to seek
additional revenue makes it likely that there will be continued proposals to
change tax rules in ways that would reduce our earnings. However, it remains
difficult to predict whether or when there will be any tax law changes having a
material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. COMPETITION and employees We face intense competition in
each of our businesses. Our businesses operate in highly
competitive environments, both domestically and overseas. Our principal competitors
are other large multinational insurance organizations, as well as banks,
investment banks and other nonbank financial institutions. The insurance
industry in particular is highly competitive. Within the U.S., our Non-Life
Insurance Companies compete with other stock companies, specialty insurance
organizations, mutual insurance companies and other underwriting organizations.
Our Life Insurance Companies compete in the U.S. with life insurance companies
and other participants in related financial services fields. Overseas, our
subsidiaries compete for business with the foreign insurance operations of
large U.S. insurers and with global insurance groups and local companies. The past reduction of our credit ratings and past negative
publicity have made, and may continue to make, it more difficult to compete to
retain existing customers and to maintain our historical levels of business
with existing customers and counterparties. General insurance and life
insurance companies compete through a combination of risk acceptance criteria,
product pricing, and terms and conditions. Retirement services companies
compete through crediting rates and the issuance of guaranteed benefits. A
decline in our position as to any one or more of these factors could adversely
affect our profitability. Competition
for employees in our industry is intense, and we may not be able to attract and
retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business. Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key
people. Due to the intense competition in our industry for key employees with
demonstrated ability, we may be unable to hire or retain such employees. Losing
any of our key people also could have a material adverse effect on our
operations given their skills, knowledge of our business, years of industry
experience and the potential difficulty of promptly finding qualified
replacement employees. Our results of operations and financial condition could
be materially adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in attracting and
retaining key employees. Managing
key employee succession and retention is critical to our success. We would be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession
of our senior management and other key employees. While we have succession
plans and long-term compensation plans designed to retain our employees, our
succession plans may not operate effectively and our compensation plans cannot
guarantee that the services of these employees will continue to be available to
us. Employee error and misconduct may be difficult to detect
and prevent and may result in significant losses. There have been a number of cases involving
fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services industry in
recent years and 41 TABLE OF CONTENTS Item 1A / risk factors we run the risk that employee
misconduct could occur. Instances of fraud, illegal acts, errors, failure to
document transactions properly or to obtain proper internal authorization,
misuse of customer or proprietary information, or failure to comply with regulatory
requirements or our internal policies may result in losses. It is not always
possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct, and the controls that we have
in place to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Estimates used in the preparation
of financial statements and modeled results used in various areas of our
business may differ materially from actual experience. Our
financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP), which requires the application of accounting
policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. The accounting
policies that we consider most dependent on the application of estimates and
assumptions, and therefore may be viewed as critical accounting estimates, are
described in Item 7. MD&A — Critical Accounting Estimates. These accounting
estimates require the use of assumptions, some of which are highly uncertain at
the time of estimation. These estimates are based on judgment, current facts
and circumstances, and, when applicable, internally developed models.
Therefore, actual results could differ from these estimates, possibly in the
near term, and could have a material effect on our consolidated financial
statements. In addition,
we employ models to price products, calculate reserves and value assets, as
well as evaluate risk and determine capital requirements, among other uses.
These models rely on estimates and projections that are inherently uncertain,
may use incomplete, outdated or incorrect data or assumptions and may not
operate properly. As our businesses continue to expand and evolve, the number
and complexity of models we employ has grown, increasing our exposure to error
in the design, implementation or use of models, including the associated input
data, controls and assumptions and the controls we have in place to mitigate
their risk may not be effective in all cases. Changes in accounting
principles and financial reporting requirements could impact our reported
results of operations and our reported financial position. Our financial statements are subject to the
application of U.S. GAAP, which is periodically revised. Accordingly, from
time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards
issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB). The impact of accounting pronouncements that have been
issued but are not yet required to be implemented is disclosed in Note 2 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. The FASB and International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)
have ongoing projects to revise accounting standards for insurance contracts. The
FASB has focused on disclosures for short-duration insurance contracts, which
primarily relate to our property casualty products, and on targeted
improvements to accounting measurements and disclosures for long-duration
insurance contracts, which primarily relate to our life and annuity products. The IASB continues to contemplate significant changes to accounting
measurements for both short and long-duration insurance contracts. While the
final resolution of changes to U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting
Standards pursuant to these projects remains unclear, changes to the manner in
which we account for insurance products could have a significant impact on our
future financial reports, operations, capital management and business. Further, the adoption of a new insurance contracts standard as well as other
future accounting standards could have a material effect on our reported
results of operations and reported financial condition. Changes in our assumptions
regarding the discount rate, expected rate of return, and expected compensation
for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans may result in increased
expenses and reduce our profitability. We
determine our pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs based on
assumed discount rates, expected rates of return on plan assets, expected increases in compensation levels and trends in health care costs. Changes in these
assumptions, including from the impact of a sustained low interest rate
environment, may result in increased expenses and reduce our profitability. See
Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on our
pension and postretirement benefit plans.
