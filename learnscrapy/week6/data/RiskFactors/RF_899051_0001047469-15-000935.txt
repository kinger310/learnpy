Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules 198 Signatures 205 Financial Statement Schedules S-1 Table of Contents Part I Item 1. Business The Allstate Corporation was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 5, 1992 to serve as the holding
company for Allstate Insurance Company. Its business is conducted principally through Allstate Insurance Company, Allstate Life Insurance Company and other subsidiaries
(collectively, including The Allstate Corporation, "Allstate"). Allstate is primarily engaged in the property-liability insurance and life insurance business. It offers its products in the United
States and Canada. The
Allstate Corporation is the largest publicly held personal lines insurer in the United States. Widely known through the "You're In Good Hands With Allstate®" slogan,
Allstate's strategy is to reinvent protection and retirement to help consumers protect what they have today and better prepare for tomorrow. Allstate is the 2 nd largest personal
property and casualty insurer in the United States on the basis of 2013 statutory direct premiums earned according to A.M. Best. In addition, according to A.M. Best, it is the nation's
16 th largest issuer of life insurance business on the basis of 2013 ordinary life insurance in force and 29 th largest on the basis of 2013 statutory admitted
assets. Allstate
has four business segments:  Allstate Protection  Discontinued Lines and Coverages  Allstate Financial  Corporate and Other To
achieve its goals in 2015, Allstate is focused on the following priorities:  grow insurance policies in force;  maintain the underlying combined ratio;  proactively manage investments to generate attractive risk adjusted returns;  modernize the operating model; and  build long-term growth platforms. In
this annual report on Form 10-K, we occasionally refer to statutory financial information. All domestic United States insurance companies are required to prepare
statutory-basis financial statements. As a result, industry data is available that enables comparisons between insurance companies, including competitors that are not subject to the requirement to
prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). We frequently use industry publications containing statutory
financial information to assess our competitive position. ALLSTATE PROTECTION SEGMENT Products and Distribution Total Allstate Protection premiums written were $29.61 billion in 2014. Our Allstate Protection segment accounted for 93% of
Allstate's 2014 consolidated insurance premiums and contract charges. In this segment, we principally sell private passenger auto and homeowners insurance through agencies and directly through contact
centers and the internet. These products are underwritten under the Allstate®, Esurance® and Encompass® brand names. Our Unique Strategy Consumer Segments 1 Table of Contents Allstate
serves four different consumer segments with distinct interaction preferences (local advice and assistance versus self-directed) and brand preferences (brand-neutral versus
brand-sensitive).  Allstate brand auto and homeowners insurance products are sold primarily through Allstate exclusive agencies and serve customers who
prefer local personalized advice and service and are brand-sensitive. The Allstate brand also sells specialty auto products including motorcycle, trailer, motor home and off-road vehicle insurance
policies; other personal lines products including renter, condominium, landlord, boat, umbrella and manufactured home insurance policies; commercial lines products for small business owners; roadside
assistance products; and service contracts and other products sold in conjunction with auto lending and vehicle sales transactions. Allstate brand sales and service are supported through contact
centers and the internet. In 2014, the Allstate brand represented 91% of the Allstate Protection segment's written premium. In the U.S., we offer these Allstate brand products through approximately
10,000 Allstate exclusive agencies in approximately 9,800 locations with approximately 23,200 licensed sales professionals. We also offer these products through approximately 2,000 independent
agencies that are primarily in rural areas in the U.S. In Canada we offer Allstate brand products through approximately 750 employee producers working in five provinces across the country (Ontario,
Quebec, Alberta, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia).  Esurance brand auto, homeowners, renter and motorcycle insurance products are sold directly to consumers online, through contact
centers and through select agents, including Answer Financial. Esurance serves self-directed, brand-sensitive customers. In 2014, the Esurance brand represented 5% of the Allstate Protection segment's
written premium.  Encompass brand auto, homeowners, umbrella and other insurance products, sold predominantly in the form of a single annual household
("package") policy, are distributed through independent agencies that serve consumers who prefer personal advice and assistance from an independent adviser and are brand neutral. Encompass targets
approximately 35 million mass affluent households (consumers with $100,000 - $500,000 in household income and net worth greater than $150,000) in the U.S., with their higher average
premiums and preference for professional advice regarding coverage needs and risk solutions. In 2014, the Encompass brand represented 4% of the Allstate Protection segment's written premium. Encompass
brand products are distributed through approximately 2,400 independent agencies. Encompass is among the top 15 largest providers of personal property and casualty insurance products through
independent agencies in the United States, based on statutory written premium information provided by A.M. Best for 2013.  Answer Financial, an independent personal lines insurance
agency, serves self-directed, brand-neutral consumers who want a choice
between insurance carriers. It offers comparison quotes for auto and homeowners insurance from approximately 25 insurance companies through its website and over the phone and receives commissions for
this service. Through
arrangements made with other companies, agencies, and brokers, the Allstate Protection segment may offer non-proprietary products to consumers when an Allstate product is not
available. As of December 31, 2014, Allstate agencies had approximately $1.3 billion of non-proprietary personal insurance premiums under management, primarily related to property
business in hurricane exposed areas, and approximately $160 million of
non-proprietary commercial insurance premiums under management. Answer Financial had $526 million of non-proprietary premiums written in 2014. Competition The markets for personal private passenger auto and homeowners insurance are highly competitive. The following charts provide the
market shares of our principal competitors in the U.S. by direct written premium for the year ended December 31, 2013 according to A.M. Best.

the personal property and casualty insurance market, we compete principally using customer value propositions for each consumer segment. This includes different brands, the scope and
type of distribution system, price and the breadth of product offerings, product features, customer service, claim handling, and use of technology. In addition, our proprietary database of
underwriting and pricing experience enables Allstate to use sophisticated pricing algorithms to more accurately price risks and to cross sell products within our customer base. The
primary focus of our sophisticated pricing methods has been on acquiring and retaining profitable business. Sophisticated pricing and underwriting methods use a number of risk
evaluation factors. For auto insurance, these factors can include but are not limited to vehicle make, model and year; driver age and marital status; territory; years licensed; loss history; years
insured with prior carrier; prior liability limits; prior lapse in coverage; and insurance scoring utilizing certain credit report information. For property insurance, these factors can include but
are not limited to amount of insurance purchased; geographic location of the property; loss history; age, condition and construction characteristics of the property; and insurance scoring utilizing
certain credit report information. Allstate
differentiates itself from competitors by focusing on the needs of the entire household and offering a comprehensive range of innovative product options and features through
distribution channels that best suit each market segment. Allstate's Your Choice Auto® insurance allows qualified customers to choose from a variety of options, such as Accident
Forgiveness, Deductible Rewards®, Safe Driving Bonus®, and New Car Replacement. We believe that Your Choice Auto insurance promotes increased growth and increased retention. We
also offer a Claim Satisfaction Guarantee sm feature that promises a return of premium to Allstate brand standard auto insurance customers dissatisfied with their claims experience.
Allstate House and Home® insurance is our homeowners product that provides options of coverage for roof damage including graduated coverage and pricing based on roof type and age. Good
Hands® Roadside Assistance is a service that provides pay on demand access to roadside services. Our
Allstate branded Drivewise® and Esurance DriveSense® offerings are usage-based insurance programs that use an in-car device or a mobile application to capture
driving behaviors and reward customers for driving safely. We are also testing additional features that extend the benefits of being connected beyond auto insurance pricing. The recently introduced
Star Driver® program encourages an ongoing conversation about safe driving through an easy-to-use application to develop teens' confidence behind the wheel. The Esurance
DriveSafe® program is designed to help parents coach teens on safe driving by providing customizable driving statistics and the ability to limit cell phone use while the car is in motion,
all controlled by a device installed in the vehicle. The
Encompass package policy simplifies the insurance experience by packaging a product with broader coverage and higher limits into a single annual household policy with one premium,
one bill, one policy deductible and one renewal date. Geographic Markets The principal geographic markets for our auto, homeowners, and other personal property and casualty products are in the United States.
Through various subsidiaries, we are authorized to sell various types of personal property and casualty insurance products in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. We also sell
personal property and casualty insurance products in Canada. The
following table reflects, in percentages, the principal geographic distribution of premiums earned for the Allstate Protection segment for 2014, based on information contained in

annuity account balances under management. New and additional deposits into these non-proprietary products were $1.9 billion in 2014. Competition We compete on a wide variety of factors, including product offerings, brand recognition, financial strength and ratings, price,
distribution and the level of customer service. The market for life insurance continues to be highly fragmented and competitive. As of December 31, 2013, there were approximately 400 groups of
life insurance companies in the United States, most of which offered one or more similar products. According to A.M. Best, as of December 31, 2013, the Allstate Financial segment is the
nation's 16 th largest issuer of life insurance and related business on the basis of 2013 ordinary life insurance in force and 29 th largest on the basis of
2013 statutory admitted assets. Geographic Markets We sell life insurance and voluntary accident and health insurance throughout the United States. Through subsidiaries, we are

from both the Allstate Protection and Allstate Financial segments. They offer Allstate brand auto and homeowners insurance policies; specialty auto products including motorcycle, trailer, motor home
and off-road vehicle insurance policies; other personal lines products including renter, condominium, landlord, boat, umbrella and manufactured home insurance policies; commercial products for small
business owners; and roadside assistance products. Allstate exclusive agencies and exclusive financial specialists offer various life insurance products, as well as voluntary accident and health
insurance products. In addition, arrangements made with other companies, agencies, and brokers allow Allstate exclusive agencies the ability to make available non-proprietary products to consumers
when an Allstate product is not available. In
the U.S., Allstate brand products are sold through approximately 10,000 Allstate exclusive agencies in approximately 9,800 locations. In addition, these agencies employ approximately
23,200 licensed sales professionals who are licensed to sell our products. We also offer these products through approximately 2,000 independent agencies in primarily rural areas in the U.S. In Canada
we offer Allstate brand products through approximately 750 producers working in five provinces across the country (Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia). We pursue opportunities for
growing Allstate brand exclusive agency distribution based on market opportunities. We
support our exclusive agencies in a variety of ways to facilitate customer service and Allstate's overall growth strategy. For example, we offer assistance with marketing, sales,
service and business processes and provide education and other resources to help them acquire more business and retain more customers. Our programs support exclusive agencies and help them grow by
offering financing to acquire other agencies and awarding additional resources to better performing agencies. We support our relationship with Allstate exclusive agencies through several national and
regional working groups:  The Agency Executive Council, led by Allstate's senior leadership, engages exclusive agencies on our customer service and growth
strategy. Membership includes approximately 20 Allstate exclusive agency owners selected on the basis of performance, thought leadership and credibility among their peer group.  The
National Advisory Board brings together Allstate's senior leadership and a cross section of Allstate exclusive agents and
exclusive financial specialists from around the country to address national business issues and develop solutions.  Regional Advisory Boards support Allstate exclusive agency owner
engagement within each of Allstate's 15 regional offices in the U.S.
and within Canada. The
compensation structure for Allstate exclusive agencies rewards agencies for delivering high value to our customers and achieving certain business outcomes such as product
profitability, net growth and household penetration. Allstate exclusive agent remuneration comprises a base commission (Property-Liability and Allstate Financial products), variable compensation and a
bonus. Variable compensation has two components: agency success factors (local presence, Allstate Financial insurance policies sold and licensed staff), which must be achieved in order to qualify for
the second component, and customer satisfaction. In addition, a bonus that is a percentage of premiums can be earned by agents who achieve a targeted loss ratio and a defined amount of Allstate
Financial sales. The bonus is earned by achieving a targeted percentage of multi-category households (customers with Allstate policies in at least two of the following product categories: vehicle,
personal property, or life and retirement) and increases in Allstate Protection (Allstate brand) and Allstate Financial policies in force. Other elements of exclusive agency compensation and support
include start-up agency bonuses, marketing support payments, technology and data allowances, regional promotions and recognition trips based on achievement. Allstate exclusive financial specialists
receive commissions for proprietary and non-proprietary sales and earn a bonus based on the volume of business produced. There are no significant changes to the compensation framework planned for
2015. 5 Table of Contents Since
Allstate brand customers prefer personal advice and assistance, all Allstate brand customers who purchase their policies directly through contact centers and the internet are
provided an Allstate agency relationship at the time of purchase. To
better serve customers who prefer local and personalized advice we are undergoing a focused effort to position agents, licensed sales professionals and financial specialists to serve
customers as trusted advisors. This means they know customers and understand the unique needs of their households, help them assess the potential risks they face and provide personalized guidance on
how to protect what matters most to them. To ensure agencies have the resources, capacity and support needed to serve customers at this level, we have efforts underway to enhance agency capabilities
while simplifying and automating service processes to enable agencies to focus more time in an advisory role. Allstate
employs field sales leaders who are responsible for recruiting and retaining Allstate agents and helping them grow their business and profitability. The field sales leaders'
compensation is aligned with agency success and includes a bonus based on the level of agent remuneration described above and agency geographic footprint.

Protection segment and the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment. Reconciliation of Claims Reserves The following tables are summary reconciliations of the beginning and ending property-liability insurance claims and claims expense
reserves, displayed individually for each of the last three years. The first table presents reserves on a gross (before reinsurance) basis. The end of year gross reserve balances are reflected in the
Consolidated Statements of 6 Table of Contents Financial

Esurance opening balance sheet reserves were reestimated in 2012 resulting in a reduction in reserves due to lower severity. The
adjustment was recorded as a reduction in goodwill and an increase in payables to the seller under the terms of the purchase agreement and therefore had no impact on claims expense or the loss ratio. (2) In
2014, 2013 and 2012, the gross change in provision attributable to prior years, primarily relate to increases for Michigan and New Jersey
unlimited personal injury protection and Discontinued Lines and Coverages reserves (see the Property-Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves section for additional discussion). (3) In
2013, the net change in provision attributable to prior years decreased $544 million compared to 2012, primarily due to lower
catastrophe reserve reestimates. (4) Reserves
for claims and claims expense are net of reinsurance of $5.69 billion, $4.66 billion and $4.01 billion as of
December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The
year-end 2014 gross reserves of $22.92 billion for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense, as determined under GAAP, were $7.00 billion more than the
net reserve balance of $15.93 billion recorded on the basis of statutory accounting practices for reports provided to state regulatory authorities. The principal differences are reinsurance
recoverables from third parties totaling $5.69 billion that reduce reserves for statutory reporting but are recorded as assets for GAAP reporting, and a liability for the reserves of the
Canadian subsidiaries for $1.14 billion. Remaining differences are due to variations in requirements between GAAP and statutory reporting. 7 Table of Contents As the tables above illustrate, Allstate's net reserve for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense at the end of 2013 decreased in 2014 by
$84 million, compared to reestimates of the gross reserves of an increase of $925 million. Net reserve reestimates in 2014, 2013 and 2012 were more favorable than the gross reserve
reestimates due to reinsurance cessions. Loss Reserve Reestimates The following Loss Reserve Reestimates table illustrates the change over time of the net reserves established for property-liability
insurance claims and claims expense at the end of the last eleven calendar years. The first section shows the reserves as originally reported at the end of the stated year. The second section, reading
down, shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years with respect
to that reserve liability. The third section, reading down, shows retroactive reestimates of the original recorded reserve as of the end of each successive year which is the result of Allstate's
expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims. The last section compares the latest reestimated reserve to the reserve originally established, and
indicates whether the original reserve was adequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims. The table also presents the gross reestimated liability as of the end of the latest reestimation
period, with separate disclosure of the related reestimated reinsurance recoverable. The

shown in the above table, the subsequent cumulative increase in the net reserves established up to December 31, 2004, in general, reflect additions to reserves in the
Discontinued Lines and Coverages Segment, primarily for asbestos and environmental liabilities, which offset the effects of favorable severity trends experienced by Allstate Protection, as discussed
more fully below. The cumulative increases in reserves established as of December 31, 2006 and 2007 are due to the shift of reserves to older accident years attributable to a reallocation of
reserves related to employee postretirement benefits to more accident years, litigation settlements, reclassification of injury and non-injury reserves to older years along with reserve strengthening
as discussed below. The
following table is derived from the Loss Reserve Reestimates table and summarizes the effect of reserve reestimates, net of reinsurance, on calendar year operations for the ten-year
period ended December 31, 2014. The total of each column details the amount of reserve reestimates made in the indicated calendar year and shows the accident years to which the reestimates are
applicable. The amounts in the total accident year column on the far right represent the cumulative reserve reestimates for the indicated accident year(s). Favorable reserve reestimates are shown in
this table in parentheses. The changes in total have generally been favorable other than 2008 which was adversely impacted due to litigation filed in conjunction with a Louisiana deadline for filing
suits related to Hurricane Katrina, as shown and discussed more fully below.

2014, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to auto severity development that was better than expected. The increased reserves in accident years 2004 &
prior is due to reserve strengthening by the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment. In
2013, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to auto severity development that was less than anticipated in previous estimates and catastrophe losses. The
increased reserves in accident years 2003 & prior is due to reserve strengthening by the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment and a reclassification of injury reserves to older years. In
2012, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to catastrophe losses and auto severity development that was less than anticipated in previous estimates. The
increased reserves in accident years 2002 & prior is due to a reclassification of injury reserves to older years and reserve strengthening. In
2011, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to auto severity development that was less than anticipated in previous estimates and catastrophe losses. The
increased reserves in accident years 2001 & prior is due to a reclassification of injury reserves to older years and reserve strengthening. In
2010, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection catastrophe losses and auto severity development that was less than anticipated in previous
estimates, partially offset by litigation settlements. The increased reserves in accident years 2000 & prior is due to litigation settlements of $100 million, a reclassification of
injury reserves to older years and reserve strengthening. 9 Table of Contents In
2009, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection catastrophe losses that were less than anticipated in previous estimates. The shift of
reserves to older accident years is attributable to a reallocation of reserves related to employee postretirement benefits to more accident years, and a reclassification of injury and 2008 non-injury
reserves to older years. In
2008, unfavorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection catastrophe losses that were more than anticipated in previous estimates. In
2007, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection auto severity development that was less than what was anticipated in previous estimates.
Decreased reserve reestimates for Allstate Protection more than offset increased reestimates of losses primarily related to environmental liabilities reported by the Discontinued Lines and Coverages
segment. In
2006 and 2005, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection auto injury severity and late reported loss development that was less than what was
anticipated in previous reserve estimates and in 2006, also by catastrophe losses that were less than anticipated in previous estimates. Decreased reserve reestimates for Allstate Protection more than
offset increased reestimates of losses primarily related to asbestos liabilities reported by the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment. For
additional information regarding reserves, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Property-Liability Claims and Claims
Expense Reserves." REGULATION Allstate is subject to extensive regulation, primarily at the state level. The method, extent, and substance of such regulation varies
by state but generally has its source in statutes that establish standards and requirements for conducting the business of insurance and that delegate regulatory authority to a state agency. These
rules have a substantial effect on our business and relate to a wide variety of matters, including insurer solvency, reserve adequacy, insurance company licensing and examination, agent and adjuster
licensing, policy forms, rate setting, the nature and amount of investments, claims practices, participation in shared markets and guaranty funds, transactions with affiliates, the payment of
dividends, underwriting standards, statutory accounting methods, trade practices, and corporate governance. Some of these matters are discussed in more detail below. For a discussion of statutory
financial information, see Note 16 of the consolidated financial statements. For a discussion of regulatory contingencies, see Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements.
Notes 14 and 16 are incorporated in this Part I, Item 1 by reference. In
recent years, the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny. As part of an effort to strengthen the regulation of the financial services market,
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("Dodd-Frank") was enacted in 2010. Some regulations required pursuant to this law must still be finalized, and we cannot predict what the
final regulations will require but do not expect a material impact on Allstate's operations. Dodd-Frank also created the Federal Insurance Office ("FIO") within the Treasury Department. The FIO
monitors the insurance industry, provides advice to the Financial Stability Oversight Council ("FSOC"), represents the U.S. on international insurance matters, and studies the current regulatory
system. FIO submitted reports to Congress in 2013 and 2014 addressing how to improve and modernize the system of insurance regulation. In addition, state legislators and insurance regulators continue
to examine the appropriate nature and scope of state insurance regulation. We cannot predict whether any specific state or federal measures will be adopted to change the nature or scope of the
regulation of insurance or what effect any such measures would have on Allstate. We are working for changes in the regulatory environment, including recognizing the need for better catastrophe
preparedness and loss mitigation, improving appropriate risk-based pricing, and promoting ways to make regulation more uniform and consistent across the country. Additional
regulations or new requirements may emerge from activities of various regulatory entities, including the Federal Reserve Board, FIO, FSOC, the National Association of
Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC"), and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors ("IAIS"), that are evaluating solvency and capital standards for insurance company groups. In addition, the
NAIC has proposed amendments to their model holding company law, which has not yet been adopted by any jurisdiction. The outcome of these actions is uncertain; however, these actions may result in an
increase in the level of capital and liquidity required by insurance holding companies. Agent and Broker Compensation. In recent years, several states considered new legislation or regulations regarding the compensation of agents
and
brokers by insurance companies. The proposals ranged in nature from new disclosure requirements to new duties on insurance agents and brokers in dealing with customers. Agents and brokers in New York
are required to disclose certain information concerning compensation. 10 Table of Contents Limitations on Dividends By Insurance Subsidiaries. As a holding company with no significant business operations of its own, The Allstate
Corporation
relies on dividends from Allstate Insurance Company as one of the principal sources of cash to pay dividends and to meet its obligations, including the payment of principal and interest on debt.
Allstate Insurance Company is regulated as an insurance company in Illinois and its ability to pay dividends is restricted by Illinois law. For additional information regarding those restrictions, see
Part II, Item 5 of this report. The laws of the other jurisdictions that generally govern our other insurance subsidiaries contain similar limitations on the payment of dividends and in
some jurisdictions the laws may be more restrictive. Insurance Holding Company Regulation  Change of Control. The Allstate Corporation and Allstate Insurance Company are insurance
holding companies subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which their insurance subsidiaries do business. In the U.S., these subsidiaries are organized under the insurance codes of California,
Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York, Texas, and Wisconsin, and some of these subsidiaries are considered commercially domiciled in California and Florida. Generally, the insurance codes in
these states provide that the acquisition or change of "control" of a domestic or commercially domiciled insurer or of any person that controls such an insurer cannot be consummated without the prior
approval of the relevant insurance regulator. In general, a presumption of "control" arises from the ownership, control, possession with the power to vote, or possession of proxies with respect to,
ten percent or more of the voting securities of an insurer or of a person that controls an insurer. In addition, certain state insurance laws require pre-acquisition notification to state agencies of
a change in control with respect to a non-domestic insurance company licensed to do business in that state. While such pre-acquisition notification statutes do not authorize the state agency to
disapprove the change of control, such statutes do authorize certain remedies, including the issuance of a cease and desist order with respect to the non-domestic insurer if certain conditions exist,
such as undue market concentration. Thus, any transaction involving the acquisition of ten percent or more of The Allstate Corporation's common stock would generally require prior approval by the
state insurance departments in California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York, Texas, and Wisconsin. The prior approval of the Florida insurance department would be necessary for the acquisition of
five percent or more. Moreover, notification would be required in those other states that have adopted pre-acquisition notification provisions and where the insurance subsidiaries are admitted to
transact business. Such approval requirements may deter, delay, or prevent certain transactions affecting the ownership of The Allstate Corporation's common stock. Rate Regulation. Nearly all states have insurance laws requiring personal property and casualty insurers to file rating plans, policy or
coverage
forms, and other information with the state's regulatory authority. In many cases, such rating plans, policy forms, or both must be approved prior to use. The
speed with which an insurer can change rates in response to competition or in response to increasing costs depends, in part, on whether the rating laws are (i) prior approval,
(ii) file-and-use, or (iii) use-and-file laws. In states having prior approval laws, the regulator must approve a rate before the insurer may use it. In states having file-and-use laws,
the insurer does not have to wait for the regulator's approval to use a rate, but the rate must be filed with the regulatory authority prior to being used. A use-and-file law requires an insurer to
file rates within a certain period of time after the insurer begins using them. Eighteen states, including California and New York, have prior approval laws. Under all three types of rating laws, the
regulator has the authority to disapprove a rate filing. An
insurer's ability to adjust its rates in response to competition or to changing costs is often dependent on an insurer's ability to demonstrate to the regulator that its rates or
proposed rating plan meets the requirements of the rating laws. In those states that significantly restrict an insurer's discretion in selecting the business that it wants to underwrite, an insurer
can manage its risk of loss by charging a rate that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance. In those states that significantly restrict an insurer's ability to charge a rate that
reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance, the insurer can manage its risk of loss by being more selective in the type of business it underwrites. When a state significantly restricts
both underwriting and pricing, it becomes more difficult for an insurer to maintain its profitability. From
time to time, the private passenger auto insurance industry comes under pressure from state regulators, legislators, and special interest groups to reduce, freeze, or set rates at
levels that do not correspond with our analysis of underlying costs and expenses. Homeowners insurance can come under similar pressure, particularly in states subject to significant increases in loss
costs from high levels of catastrophe losses. We expect this kind of pressure to persist. In addition, Allstate and other insurers are using increasingly sophisticated pricing models that are being
reviewed by regulators and special interest groups. The result could be legislation or regulation that adversely affects profitability or growth. We cannot predict the impact on our business of
possible future legislative and regulatory measures regarding rating. 11 Table of Contents Involuntary Markets. As a condition of maintaining our licenses to write personal property and casualty insurance in various states, we are
required
to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities, and joint underwriting associations that provide various types of insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable
to purchase such coverage from private insurers. Underwriting results related to these arrangements, which tend to be adverse, have been immaterial to our results of operations. Michigan Catastrophic Claim Association. The Michigan Catastrophic Claim Association ("MCCA") is a mandatory insurance coverage and
reinsurance
indemnification mechanism for personal injury protection losses that provides indemnification for losses over a retention level that increases every other MCCA fiscal year. It operates similar to a
reinsurance program and is funded by participating companies through a per vehicle annual assessment that is currently $186. This assessment is included in the premiums we charge our customers and
when collected, we remit the assessment to the MCCA. The participating company retention level is $530 thousand per claim for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2015, and June 30,
2014. The MCCA provides unlimited lifetime medical benefits for
qualifying injuries from automobile and motorcycle accidents. Many of these injuries are catastrophic in nature, resulting in serious permanent disabilities that require attendant and residential care
for periods that may span decades. The MCCA may not be funded on an actuarial basis and can accumulate unfunded claims liabilities. As required for a member company, we report covered paid and unpaid
claims to the MCCA, when estimates of loss for a reported claim are expected to exceed the retention level. The MCCA reimburses members as qualifying claims are paid and billed by members to the MCCA.
Because of the nature of the coverage, losses (the most significant of which are for residential and attendant care) may be paid over the lifetime of a claimant, and accordingly, significant levels of
incurred claims reserves are recorded by member companies as well as offsetting reinsurance recoverables. The MCCA currently has unfunded claims liabilities with an obligation to indemnify its
members. The MCCA's future operation and form are dependent upon the continuation of enabling state legislation. We do not anticipate any material adverse financial impact from this entity on
Allstate. New Jersey Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund. The New Jersey Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund ("NJUCJF") provides compensation to
qualified
claimants for bodily injury or death caused by private passenger automobiles operated by uninsured or "hit and run" drivers. The fund also provides reimbursement to insurers for the medical benefits
portion of personal injury protection coverage paid in excess of $75,000 with no limits for policies issued or renewed prior to January 1, 1991 and in excess of $75,000 and capped at $250,000
for policies issued or renewed from January 1, 1991 to December 31, 2004. NJUCJF expenses are assessed on companies writing motor vehicle liability insurance in New Jersey annually based
on their private passenger and commercial automobile written premiums. The NJUCJF was merged into the New Jersey Property Liability Guaranty Association who collects the assessments. We do not
anticipate any material adverse financial impact from this entity on Allstate. Guaranty Funds. Under state insurance guaranty fund laws, insurers doing business in a state can be assessed, up to prescribed limits, in
order to
cover certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies. National Flood Insurance Program. We voluntarily participate as a Write Your Own carrier in the National Flood Insurance Program ("NFIP").
The NFIP
is administered and regulated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. We operate in a fiduciary capacity as a fiscal agent of the federal government in the issuing and administering of the
Standard Flood Insurance Policy. This involves the collection of premiums belonging to the federal government and the paying of covered claims by directly drawing on funds of the United States
Treasury. We receive expense allowances from the NFIP for underwriting administration, claims management and commissions and are reimbursed for adjuster fees. The federal government is obligated to
pay all claims that fall under the arrangement. Investment Regulation. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that require investment portfolio diversification and that limit
the
amount of investment in certain categories. Failure to comply with these rules leads to the treatment of non-conforming investments as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus.
Further, in some instances, these rules require divestiture of non-conforming investments. Exiting Geographic Markets; Canceling and Non-Renewing Policies. Most states regulate an insurer's ability to exit a
market. For example, states may limit, to varying degrees, an insurer's ability to cancel and non-renew policies. Some states restrict or prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more types of
insurance business from the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. Regulations that limit cancellation and non-renewal and that subject withdrawal plans
to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer's ability to exit unprofitable markets. Variable Life Insurance and Registered Fixed Annuities. The sale and administration of variable life insurance and registered fixed annuities
with
market value adjustment features are subject to extensive regulatory oversight at the 12 Table of Contents federal
and state level, including regulation and supervision by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA"). Broker-Dealers, Investment Advisors, and Investment Companies. The Allstate entities that operate as broker-dealers, registered investment
advisors,
and investment companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the SEC, FINRA and/or, in some cases, state securities administrators. Privacy Regulation. Federal law and the laws of many states require financial institutions to protect the security and confidentiality of
customer
information and to notify customers about their policies and practices relating to collection and disclosure of customer information and their policies relating to protecting the security and
confidentiality of that information. Federal law and the laws of many states also regulate disclosures and disposal of customer information. Congress, state legislatures, and regulatory authorities
are expected to consider additional regulation relating to privacy and other aspects of customer information. Asbestos. Congress has considered legislation to address asbestos claims and litigation in the past, but sufficient support among various
defendant
and insurer groups considered essential to any possible reform has been lacking. We cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative measures regarding asbestos. Environmental. Environmental pollution and clean-up of polluted waste sites is the subject of both federal and state regulation. The
Comprehensive
Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ("Superfund") and comparable state statutes ("mini-Superfund") govern the clean-up and restoration of waste sites by Potentially
Responsible Parties ("PRPs"). Superfund and the mini-Superfunds (Environmental Clean-up Laws or
"ECLs") establish a mechanism to assign liability to PRPs or to fund the clean-up of waste sites if PRPs fail to do so. The extent of liability to be allocated to a PRP is dependent on a variety of
factors. By some estimates, there are thousands of potential waste sites subject to clean-up, but the exact number is unknown. The extent of clean-up necessary and the process of assigning liability
remain in dispute. The insurance industry is involved in extensive litigation regarding coverage issues arising out of the clean-up of waste sites by insured PRPs and the insured parties' alleged
liability to third parties responsible for the clean-up. The insurance industry, including Allstate, has disputed and is disputing many such claims. Key coverage issues include whether Superfund
response, investigation, and clean-up costs are considered damages under the policies; trigger of coverage; the applicability of several types of pollution exclusions; proper notice of claims; whether
administrative liability triggers the duty to defend; appropriate allocation of liability among triggered insurers; and whether the liability in question falls within the definition of an
"occurrence." Identical coverage issues exist for clean-up and waste sites not covered under Superfund. To date, courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these issues. Allstate's exposure to
liability with regard to its insureds that have been, or may be, named as PRPs is uncertain. While comprehensive Superfund reform proposals have been introduced in Congress, only modest reform
measures have been enacted. INTERNET WEBSITE Our Internet website address is allstate.com. The Allstate Corporation's annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on

subject to uncertainty. These statements are made subject to the safe-harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to
historical or current facts 14 Table of Contents and
may be identified by their use of words like "plans," "seeks," "expects," "will," "should," "anticipates," "estimates," "intends," "believes," "likely," "targets" and other words with similar
meanings. These statements may address, among other things, our strategy for growth, catastrophe exposure management, product development, investment results, regulatory approvals, market position,
expenses, financial results, litigation and reserves. We believe that these statements are based on reasonable estimates, assumptions and plans. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on
which they are made, and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. In addition, forward-looking statements are
subject to certain risks or uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those communicated in these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but
are not limited to, those described in Part 1, "Item 1A. Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this report and those described from time to time in our other reports filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the normal risks of business, we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including those listed below, which
apply to us as an insurer and a provider of other products and financial services. These cautionary statements are not exclusive and are in addition to other factors discussed elsewhere in this
document, in our filings with the SEC or in materials incorporated therein by reference. Risks Relating to the Property-Liability business As a property and casualty insurer, we may face significant losses from catastrophes and severe
weather events Because of the exposure of our property and casualty business to catastrophic events, Allstate Protection's operating results and
financial condition may vary significantly from one period to the next. Catastrophes can be caused by various natural and man-made events, including earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, wildfires,
tornadoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, tropical storms and certain types of terrorism or industrial accidents. We may incur catastrophe losses in our auto and property business in excess of:
(1) those experienced in prior years, (2) the average expected level used in pricing, (3) our current reinsurance coverage limits, or (4) loss estimates from external
hurricane and earthquake models at various levels of probability. Despite our catastrophe management programs, we are exposed to catastrophes that could have a material effect on our operating results
and financial condition. For example, our historical catastrophe experience includes losses relating to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 totaling $3.6 billion, the Northridge earthquake of 1994
totaling $2.1 billion and Hurricane Andrew in 1992 totaling $2.3 billion. We are also exposed to assessments from the California Earthquake Authority and various state-created insurance
facilities, and to losses that could surpass the capitalization of these facilities. Although we have historically financed the settlement of catastrophes from operating cash flows, including very
large catastrophes that had complicated issues resulting in settlement delays, our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe, or multiple catastrophes, which result in extraordinary losses or a
downgrade of our debt or financial strength ratings. In
addition, we are subject to claims arising from weather events such as winter storms, rain, hail and high winds. The incidence and severity of weather conditions are largely
unpredictable. There is generally an increase in the frequency and severity of auto and property claims when severe weather conditions occur. The nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be predicted and could be material to our
operating results and financial condition Along with others in the insurance industry, Allstate Protection uses models developed by third party vendors as well as our own
historic data in assessing our property insurance exposure to catastrophe losses. These models assume various conditions and probability scenarios. Such models do not necessarily accurately predict
future losses or accurately measure losses currently incurred. Catastrophe models, which have been evolving since the early 1990s, use historical information and scientific research about hurricanes
and earthquakes and also utilize detailed information about our in-force business. While we use this information in connection with our pricing and risk management activities, there are limitations
with respect to its usefulness in predicting losses in any reporting period as actual catastrophic events vary considerably. Other limitations are evident in significant variations in estimates
between models, material increases and decreases in results due to model changes and refinements of the underlying data elements and actual conditions that are not yet well understood or may not be
properly incorporated into the models. Impacts of catastrophes and our catastrophe management strategy may adversely affect premium growth Due to Allstate Protection's catastrophe risk management efforts, the size of our homeowners business has been negatively impacted and
may be negatively impacted if we take further actions. Homeowners premium growth rates and retention could be adversely impacted by adjustments to our business structure, size and underwriting
practices in 15 Table of Contents markets
with significant severe weather and catastrophe risk exposure. In addition, due to the diminished potential for cross-selling opportunities that cannot be fully replaced by brokering
arrangements that allow our agents to write property products with other carriers, new business growth in our auto lines has been and could be lower than expected. A regulatory environment that limits rate increases and requires us to underwrite business and
participate in loss sharing arrangements may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition From time to time, political events and positions affect the insurance market, including efforts to suppress rates to a level that may
not allow us to reach targeted levels of profitability. For example, if Allstate Protection's loss ratio compares favorably to that of the industry, state or provincial regulatory authorities may
impose rate rollbacks, require us to pay premium refunds to policyholders, or resist or delay our efforts to raise rates even if the property and casualty industry generally is not experiencing
regulatory resistance to rate increases. Such resistance affects our ability, in all product lines, to obtain approval for rate changes that may be required to achieve targeted levels of profitability
and returns on equity. Our ability to afford reinsurance required to reduce our catastrophe risk in designated areas may be dependent upon the ability to adjust rates for its cost. In
addition to regulating rates, certain states have enacted laws that require a property-liability insurer conducting business in that state to participate in assigned risk plans,
reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations or require the insurer to offer coverage to all consumers, often restricting an insurer's ability to charge the price it might otherwise
charge. In these markets, we may be compelled to underwrite significant amounts of business at lower than desired rates, possibly leading to an unacceptable return on equity, or as the facilities
recognize a financial deficit, they may in turn have the ability to assess participating insurers, adversely affecting our results of operations and financial condition. Laws and regulations of many
states also limit an insurer's ability to withdraw from one or more lines of insurance in the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. Additionally, certain
states require insurers to participate in guaranty funds for impaired or insolvent insurance companies. These funds periodically assess losses against all insurance companies doing business in the
state. Our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected by any of these factors. The potential benefits of our sophisticated risk segmentation process may not be fully realized We believe that our sophisticated pricing and underwriting methods (which, in some situations, considers information that is obtained
from credit reports and other factors) has allowed us to be more competitive and operate more profitably. However, because many of our competitors seek to adopt underwriting criteria and sophisticated
pricing models similar to those we use, our competitive advantage could decline or be lost. Further, the use of increasingly sophisticated pricing models is being reviewed by regulators and special
interest groups. Competitive pressures could also force us to modify our sophisticated pricing models. Furthermore, we cannot be assured that these sophisticated pricing models will accurately reflect
the level of losses that we will ultimately incur. Changes in the level of price competition and the use of underwriting standards in the property and
casualty business may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition The property and casualty market has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive
underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates. A
downturn in the profitability of the property and casualty business could have a material effect on our operating results and financial condition. Unexpected increases in the severity or frequency of claims may adversely affect our operating
results and financial condition Unexpected changes in the severity or frequency of claims may affect the profitability of our Allstate Protection segment. Changes in
bodily injury claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in the medical sector of the economy and litigation. Changes in auto physical damage claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in
auto repair costs, auto parts prices and used car prices. Changes in homeowners claim severity are driven by inflation in the construction industry, building materials and home furnishings, changes in
the mix of loss type, and by other economic and environmental factors, including increased demand for services and supplies in areas affected by catastrophes. However, changes in the level of the
severity of claims are not limited to the effects of inflation and demand surge in these various sectors of the economy. Increases in claim severity can arise from unexpected events that are
inherently difficult to predict. Although we pursue various loss management initiatives in the Allstate Protection segment in order to mitigate future increases in claim severity, there can be no
assurances that these initiatives will successfully identify or reduce the effect of future increases in claim severity. 16 Table of Contents Our
Allstate Protection segment may experience volatility in claim frequency from time to time, and short-term trends may not continue over the longer term. A significant increase in
claim frequency could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Actual claims incurred may exceed current reserves established for claims and may adversely affect
our operating results and financial condition Recorded claim reserves in the Property-Liability business are based on our best estimates of losses, both reported and incurred but
not reported claims reserves ("IBNR"), after considering known facts and interpretations of circumstances. Internal factors are considered including our experience with similar cases, actual claims
paid, historical trends involving claim payment patterns, pending levels of unpaid claims, loss management programs, product mix and contractual terms. External factors are also considered, such as
court decisions; changes in law; litigation imposing unintended coverage and benefits such as disallowing the use of benefit payment schedules, requiring coverage designed to cover losses that occur
in a single policy period to losses that develop continuously over multiple policy periods or requiring the availability of multiple limits; regulatory requirements and economic conditions. Because
reserves are estimates of the unpaid portion of losses that have occurred, including IBNR losses, the establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophes, is an inherently
uncertain and complex process. The ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded reserves and such variance may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Predicting claim expense relating to asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines is
inherently uncertain and may have a material effect on our operating results and financial condition The process of estimating asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines liabilities is complicated by complex legal issues
concerning, among other things, the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether losses are covered, or were ever intended to be covered, and whether losses could be recoverable
through retrospectively determined premium, reinsurance or other contractual agreements. Asbestos-related bankruptcies and other asbestos litigation are complex, lengthy proceedings that involve
substantial uncertainty for insurers. Actuarial techniques and databases used in estimating asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines net loss reserves may prove to be inadequate indicators
of the extent of probable loss. Ultimate net losses from these discontinued lines could materially exceed established loss reserves and expected recoveries and have a material effect on our operating
results and financial condition. Risks Relating to the Allstate Financial Segment Changes in underwriting and actual experience could materially affect profitability and financial
condition Our product pricing includes long-term assumptions regarding investment returns, mortality, morbidity, persistency and operating costs
and expenses of the business. We establish target returns for each product based upon these factors and the average amount of capital that we must hold to support in-force contracts taking into
account rating agencies and regulatory requirements. We monitor and manage our pricing and overall sales mix to achieve target new business returns on a portfolio basis, which could result in the
discontinuation or de-emphasis of products and a decline in sales. Profitability from new business emerges over a period of years depending on the nature and life of the product and is subject to
variability as actual results may differ from pricing assumptions. Additionally, many of our products have fixed or guaranteed terms that limit our ability to increase revenues or reduce benefits,
including credited interest, once the product has been issued. Our
profitability in this segment depends on the sufficiency of premiums and contract charges to cover mortality and morbidity benefits, the persistency of policies to ensure recovery of
acquisition expenses, the adequacy of investment spreads, the management of market and credit risks associated with investments, and the management of operating costs and expenses within anticipated
pricing allowances. Legislation and regulation of the insurance marketplace and products could also affect our profitability and financial condition. Changes in reserve estimates may adversely affect our operating results The reserve for life-contingent contract benefits payable under insurance policies, including traditional life insurance,
life-contingent immediate annuities and voluntary accident and health insurance products, is computed on the basis of long-term actuarial assumptions of future investment yields, mortality, morbidity,
persistency and expenses. We periodically review the adequacy of these reserves on an aggregate basis and if future experience differs significantly from assumptions, adjustments to reserves and
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs ("DAC") may be required that could have a material effect on our operating results. 17 Table of Contents Changes in market interest rates may lead to a significant decrease in the profitability of
spread-based products Our ability to manage the in-force Allstate Financial spread-based products, such as fixed annuities, is dependent upon maintaining
profitable spreads between investment yields and interest crediting rates. When market interest rates decrease or remain at relatively low levels, proceeds from investments that have matured or have
been prepaid or sold may be reinvested at lower yields, reducing investment spread. Lowering interest crediting rates on some products in such an environment can partially offset decreases in
investment
yield. However, these changes could be limited by regulatory minimum rates or contractual minimum rate guarantees on many contracts and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in investment
yields. Increases in market interest rates can have negative effects on Allstate Financial, for example by increasing the attractiveness of other investments to our customers, which can lead to
increased surrenders at a time when the segment's fixed income investment asset values are lower as a result of the increase in interest rates. This could lead to the sale of fixed income securities
at a loss. In addition, changes in market interest rates impact the valuation of derivatives embedded in equity-indexed annuity contracts that are not hedged, which could lead to volatility in net
income. Changes in estimates of profitability on interest-sensitive life products may adversely affect our
profitability and financial condition through the amortization of DAC DAC related to interest-sensitive life contracts is amortized in proportion to actual historical gross profits and estimated future
gross profits ("EGP") over the estimated lives of the contracts. The principal assumptions for determining the amount of EGP are mortality, persistency, expenses, investment returns, including capital
gains and losses on assets supporting contract liabilities, interest crediting rates to contractholders, and the effects of any hedges. Updates to these assumptions (commonly referred to as "DAC
unlocking") could result in accelerated amortization of DAC and thereby adversely affect our profitability and financial condition. Reducing our concentration in spread-based business and exiting certain distribution channels may
adversely affect reported results We have been reducing our concentration in spread-based business and discontinued offering fixed annuities effective January 1,
2014. We also exited the independent master brokerage agencies and structured settlement annuity brokers distribution channels in 2013 and sold Lincoln Benefit Life Company ("LBL") on April 1,
2014. The reduction in sales of these products has and may continue to reduce investment portfolio levels. It may also complicate settlement of contract benefits including forced sales of assets with
unrealized capital losses, and affect goodwill impairment testing and insurance reserves deficiency testing. We plan to outsource the administration of our annuity business to a third party
administration company in 2015 following the successful transition of the servicing of the LBL business that was sold. If our efforts are unsuccessful, our cost structure may be less competitive. Changes in tax laws may decrease sales and profitability of products and adversely affect our
financial condition Under current federal and state income tax law, certain products we offer, primarily life insurance, receive favorable tax treatment.
This favorable treatment may give certain of our products a competitive advantage over noninsurance products. Congress and various state legislatures from time to time consider legislation that would
reduce or eliminate the favorable policyholder tax treatment currently applicable to life insurance. Congress and various state legislatures also consider proposals to reduce the taxation of certain
products or investments that may compete with life insurance. Legislation that increases the taxation on insurance products or reduces the taxation on competing products could lessen the advantage or
create a disadvantage for
certain of our products making them less competitive. Such proposals, if adopted, could have a material effect on our profitability and financial condition or ability to sell such products and could
result in the surrender of some existing contracts and policies. In addition, changes in the federal estate tax laws could negatively affect the demand for the types of life insurance used in estate
planning. We may not be able to mitigate the capital impact associated with statutory reserving requirements,
potentially resulting in a need to increase prices, reduce sales of term or universal life products, and/or a return on equity below original levels assumed in pricing To support statutory reserves for certain term and universal life insurance products with secondary guarantees, we currently utilize
reinsurance and capital markets solutions for financing a portion of our statutory reserve requirements deemed to be non-economic. As we continue to underwrite term and universal life business, we
expect to have additional financing needs to mitigate the impact of these reserve requirements. If we do not obtain additional financing as a result of market conditions or otherwise, this could
require us to increase prices, reduce our sales of term or universal life products, and/or result in a return on equity below original levels assumed in pricing. 18 Table of Contents Dispositions and acquisitions of businesses may adversely affect our results of operations including
the ability to continue sales by Allstate exclusive agents and receive adequate compensation for transition services We are exposed to risks associated with disposed former affiliates when continuing relationships are maintained such as distribution
rights, reinsurance of new and in-force business, transition services and other contingent liabilities. We may be adversely impacted by declines in financial strength ratings of disposed former
affiliates due to rating agencies viewing the financial capacity of the former affiliate differently. Other compliance and operational issues may emerge involving agents, products, pricing, servicing
and claims related to the business reinsured from the former affiliate to the Company. In addition, during a transition period when the Company may be providing transition services, we may not be
receiving adequate compensation and could be judged as not providing service as contracted. These risks may adversely affect our results of operations. Risks Relating to Investments We are subject to market risk and declines in credit quality which may adversely affect investment
income and cause realized and unrealized losses Although we continually reevaluate our investment management strategies, we remain subject to the risk that we will incur losses due to
adverse changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices or currency exchange rates. Adverse changes in these rates, spreads and prices may occur due to changes in monetary policy and the
economic climate, the liquidity of a market or market segment, investor return expectations and/or risk tolerance, insolvency or financial distress of key market makers or participants, or changes in
market perceptions of credit worthiness. We are also subject to market risk related to investments in real estate, loans and securities collateralized by real estate. Some of our investment strategies
target individual investments with unique risks that are not highly correlated with broad market risks. Although we expect these investments to increase total portfolio returns over time, their
performance may vary from and under-perform relative to the market in some periods. We
are subject to risks associated with potential declines in credit quality related to specific issuers or specific industries and a general weakening in the economy, which are
typically reflected through credit spreads. Credit spread is the additional yield on fixed income securities and loans above the risk-free rate (typically referenced as the yield on U.S. Treasury
securities) that market participants require to compensate them for assuming credit, liquidity and/or prepayment risks. Credit spreads vary (i.e. increase or decrease) in response to the
market's perception of risk and liquidity in a specific issuer or specific sector and are influenced by the credit ratings, and the reliability of those ratings, published by external rating agencies.
Although we have the ability to use derivative financial instruments to manage these risks, the effectiveness of such instruments varies with liquidity and other conditions that may impact derivative
and bond markets. Adverse economic conditions or other factors could cause declines in the quality and valuation of our investment portfolio that could result in realized and unrealized losses. The
concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular issuer, industry, collateral type, group of related industries, geographic sector or risk type could have an adverse effect on our
investment portfolios and consequently on our results of operations and financial condition. A
decline in market interest rates or credit spreads could have an adverse effect on our investment income as we invest cash in new investments that may earn less than the portfolio's
average yield. In a declining interest rate environment, borrowers may prepay or redeem securities more quickly than expected as they seek to refinance at lower rates. A decline could also lead us to
purchase longer-term or riskier assets in order to obtain adequate investment yields resulting in a duration gap when compared to the duration of liabilities. Alternatively, longer-term assets may be
sold and reinvested in shorter-term assets in anticipation of rising interest rates. An increase in market interest rates or credit spreads could have an adverse effect on the value of our investment
portfolio by decreasing the fair values of the fixed income securities that comprise a substantial majority of our investment portfolio. Declining equity markets could also cause the investments in
our pension plans to decrease and decreasing interest rates could cause the funding target and the projected benefit obligation of our pension plans or the accumulated benefit obligation of our other
postretirement benefit plans to increase, either or both resulting in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plans and a reduction in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of
shareholders' equity, increases in pension and other postretirement benefit expense and increases in required contributions to the pension plans. The determination of the amount of realized capital losses recorded for impairments of our
investments is subjective and could materially impact our operating results and financial condition The determination of the amount of realized capital losses recorded for impairments vary by investment type and is based upon our
ongoing evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes
available. We update our evaluations regularly and reflect changes in other-than-temporary impairments in our results of operations. 19 Table of Contents The
assessment of whether other-than-temporary impairments have occurred is based on our case-by-case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value. Our conclusions on such
assessments are judgmental and include assumptions and projections of future cash flows and price recovery which may ultimately prove to be incorrect as assumptions, facts and circumstances change.
Furthermore, historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments and additional impairments may need to be recorded in the future. The determination of the fair value of our fixed income and equity securities is subjective and
could materially impact our operating results and financial condition In determining fair values we principally use the market approach which utilizes market transaction data for the same or similar
instruments. The degree of judgment involved in determining fair values is inversely related to the availability of market observable information. The fair value of assets may differ from the actual
amount received upon sale of an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Moreover, the use of different valuation assumptions may have a material effect on
the assets' fair values. The difference between amortized cost or cost and fair value, net of deferred income taxes, certain life and annuity DAC, certain deferred sales inducement costs, and certain
reserves for life-contingent contract benefits, is reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity. Changing market conditions could materially affect the
determination of the fair value of securities and unrealized net capital gains and losses could vary significantly. Risks Relating to the Insurance Industry Our future growth and profitability are dependent in part on our ability to successfully operate in
an insurance industry that is highly competitive The insurance industry is highly competitive. Many of our primary insurance competitors have well-established national reputations and
market similar products. We
have invested in growth strategies by acting on our customer value propositions for each of our brands, through our differentiated product offerings and our distinctive advertising
campaigns. If we are unsuccessful in generating new business and retaining a sufficient number of our customers, our ability to increase premiums written could be impacted. In addition, if we
experience unexpected increases in our underlying costs (such as the frequency or severity of claims costs) generated by our new business, it could result in decreases in our profitability and lead to
price increases which could impair our ability to compete effectively for insurance business. We
are also investing in telematics and broadening the value proposition for the connected consumer. If we are not effective in anticipating the impact on our business of changing
technology, including automotive technology, our ability to successfully operate may be impaired. Because
of the competitive nature of the insurance industry, there can be no assurance that we will continue to effectively compete with our industry rivals, or that competitive
pressures will not have a material effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. This includes competition for producers such as exclusive and independent agents and their licensed
sales professionals. In the event we are unable to attract and retain these producers or they are unable to attract and retain customers for our products, growth and retention could be materially
affected. Furthermore, certain competitors operate using a mutual insurance company structure and therefore may have dissimilar profitability and return targets. Additionally, many of our voluntary
benefits products are underwritten annually. There is a risk that employers may be able to obtain more favorable terms from competitors than they could by renewing coverage with us. These competitive
pressures may adversely affect the persistency of these products, as well as our ability to sell our products in the future. Our
ability to successfully operate may also be impaired if we are not effective in developing the talent and skills of our human resources, attracting and assimilating new executive
talent into our organization, or deploying human resource talent consistently with our business goals. Difficult conditions in the global economy and capital markets generally could adversely affect our
business and operating results and these conditions may not improve in the near future As with most businesses, we believe difficult conditions in the global economy and capital markets, such as significant negative
macroeconomic trends, including relatively high and sustained unemployment, reduced consumer spending, lower residential and commercial real estate prices, substantial increases in delinquencies on
consumer debt, including defaults on home mortgages, and the relatively low availability of credit could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. 20 Table of Contents Stressed
conditions, volatility and disruptions in global capital markets, particular markets or financial asset classes could adversely affect our investment portfolio. Disruptions in
one market or asset class can also spread to other markets or asset classes. Although the disruption in the global financial markets has moderated, not all global financial markets are functioning
normally, and the rate of recovery from the U.S. recession has been below historic averages. Several governments around the world have announced austerity actions to address their budget deficits that
may lead to a decline in economic activity. In
the years since the financial crisis, the central banks of most developed countries have pursued fairly similar, and highly accommodative, monetary policies. While European policy
makers have developed mechanisms to address funding concerns, risks to the European economy and financial markets remain. Additionally, monetary policies among major central banks have begun to
diverge. The United States Federal Reserve and the Bank of England continue to evaluate the timing and pace of normalizing their respective policies. In contrast, the European Central Bank has
recently launched a quantitative easing program and several central banks have lowered their benchmark interest rates to stimulate economic activity. The diverging policies are likely to result in
higher volatility and less certainty in capital markets. General
economic conditions could adversely affect us in the form of consumer behavior and pressure investment results. Consumer behavior changes could include decreased demand for our
products. For example, if consumers purchase fewer automobiles, our sales of auto insurance may decline. Also, if consumers become more cost conscious, they may choose lower levels of auto and
homeowners insurance. In addition, holders of some of our interest-sensitive life insurance and annuity products may engage in an elevated level of discretionary withdrawals of contractholder funds.
Our investment results could be adversely affected as deteriorating financial and business conditions affect the issuers of the securities in our investment portfolio. Losses from legal and regulatory actions may be material to our operating results, cash flows and
financial condition As is typical for a large company, we are involved in various legal actions, including class action litigation challenging a range of
company practices and coverage provided by our insurance products, some of which involve claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts. We are also involved in various regulatory actions and
inquiries, including market conduct exams by state insurance regulatory agencies. In the event of an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these matters, the ultimate liability may be in excess of
amounts currently accrued and may be material to our operating results or cash flows for a particular quarter or annual period and to our financial condition. The aggregate estimate of the range of
reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued, if any, disclosed in Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements is not an indication of expected loss, if any. Actual results may
vary significantly from the current estimate. We are subject to extensive regulation and potential further restrictive regulation may increase our
operating costs and limit our growth As insurance companies, broker-dealers, investment advisers and/or investment companies, many of our subsidiaries are subject to
extensive laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are complex and subject to change. Changes may sometimes lead to additional expenses, increased legal exposure, and additional limits on our
ability to grow or to achieve targeted profitability. Moreover, laws and regulations are administered and enforced by a number of different governmental authorities, each of which exercises a degree
of interpretive latitude, including state insurance regulators; state securities administrators; state attorneys general and federal agencies including the SEC, the FINRA and the U.S. Department of
Justice. Consequently, we are subject to the risk that compliance with any particular regulator's or enforcement authority's interpretation of a legal issue may not result in compliance with another's
interpretation of the same issue, particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight. In addition, there is risk that any particular regulator's or enforcement authority's interpretation of a legal
issue may change over time to our detriment, or that changes in the overall legal environment may, even absent any particular regulator's or enforcement authority's interpretation of a legal issue
changing, cause us to change our views regarding the actions we need to take from a legal risk management perspective, thus necessitating changes to our practices that may, in some cases, limit our
ability to grow or to improve the profitability of our business. Furthermore, in some cases, these laws and regulations are designed to protect or benefit the interests of a specific constituency
rather than a range of constituencies. For example, state insurance laws and regulations are generally intended to protect or benefit purchasers or users of insurance products, not holders of
securities, which is generally the jurisdiction of the SEC, issued by The Allstate Corporation. In many respects, these laws and regulations limit our ability to grow or to improve the profitability
of our business. 21 Table of Contents Regulatory reforms, and the more stringent application of existing regulations, may make it more
expensive for us to conduct our business The federal government has enacted comprehensive regulatory reforms for financial services entities. As part of a larger effort to
strengthen the regulation of the financial services market, certain reforms are applicable to the insurance industry, including the FIO established within the Treasury Department. In
recent years, the state insurance regulatory framework has come under public scrutiny, members of Congress have discussed proposals to provide for federal chartering of insurance
companies, and the FIO and FSOC were established. In the future, if the FSOC were to determine that Allstate is a "systemically important" nonbank financial company, Allstate would be subject to
regulation by the Federal Reserve Board. We can make no assurances regarding the potential impact of state or federal measures that may change the nature or scope of insurance and financial
regulation. These
regulatory reforms and any additional legislative change or regulatory requirements imposed upon us in connection with the federal government's regulatory reform of the financial
services industry or arising from reform related to the international regulatory capital framework for financial services firms, and any more stringent enforcement of existing regulations by federal
authorities, may make it more expensive for us to conduct our business, or limit our ability to grow or to achieve profitability. Reinsurance may be unavailable at current levels and prices, which may limit our ability to write
new business Our personal lines catastrophe reinsurance program was designed, utilizing our risk management methodology, to address our exposure to
catastrophes nationwide. Market conditions beyond our control impact the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase. No assurances can be made that reinsurance will remain continuously
available to us to the same extent and on the same terms and rates as is currently available. For example, our ability to afford reinsurance to reduce our catastrophe risk in designated areas may be
dependent upon our ability to adjust premium rates for its cost, and there are no assurances that the terms and rates for our current reinsurance program will continue to be available in future years.
If we were unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable, we would have to
either accept an increase in our catastrophe exposure, reduce our insurance writings, or develop or seek other alternatives. Reinsurance subjects us to the credit risk of our reinsurers and may not be adequate to protect us
against losses arising from ceded insurance, which could have a material effect on our operating results and financial condition The collectability of reinsurance recoverables is subject to uncertainty arising from a number of factors, including changes in market
conditions, whether insured losses meet the qualifying conditions of the reinsurance contract and whether reinsurers, or their affiliates, have the financial capacity and willingness to make payments
under the terms of a reinsurance treaty or contract. We also have credit risk exposure associated with the MCCA, a mandatory insurance coverage and reinsurance indemnification mechanism for personal
injury protection losses that provides indemnification for losses over a retention level that increases every other MCCA fiscal year, which is operating with a deficit, and the NJUCJF that provides
reimbursement to insurers for the medical benefits portion of personal injury protection coverage paid in excess of certain levels. Our reinsurance recoverable from the MCCA and NJUCJF was
$4.42 billion and $508 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2014. Our inability to collect a material recovery from a reinsurer could have a material effect on our operating
results and financial condition. A downgrade in our financial strength ratings may have an adverse effect on our competitive
position, the marketability of our product offerings, our liquidity, access to and cost of borrowing, operating results and financial condition Financial strength ratings are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and generally have an
effect on an insurance company's business. On an ongoing basis, rating agencies review our financial performance and condition and could downgrade or change the outlook on our ratings due to, for
example, a change in one of our insurance company's statutory capital; a change in a
rating agency's determination of the amount of risk-adjusted capital required to maintain a particular rating; an increase in the perceived risk of our investment portfolio; a reduced confidence in
management or our business strategy; as well as a number of other considerations that may or may not be under our control. The insurance financial strength ratings of Allstate Insurance Company and
Allstate Life Insurance Company and The Allstate Corporation's senior debt ratings from A.M. Best, Standard & Poor's and Moody's are subject to continuous review, and the retention of
current ratings cannot be assured. A downgrade in any of these ratings could have a material effect on our sales, our competitiveness, the marketability of our product offerings, our liquidity, access
to and cost of borrowing, operating results and financial condition. 22 Table of Contents Adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity
needs or our ability to obtain credit on acceptable terms In periods of extreme volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets, liquidity and credit capacity may be severely
restricted. In such circumstances, our ability to obtain capital to fund operating expenses, financing costs, capital expenditures or acquisitions may be limited, and the cost of any such capital may
be significant. Our access to additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to our
industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as lenders' perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects. Similarly, our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory
authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. If a combination of these factors were to occur, our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and in such case, we
may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms. The failure in cyber or other information security systems, as well as the occurrence of events
unanticipated in our disaster recovery systems and management continuity planning could result in a loss or disclosure of confidential information, damage to our reputation, additional costs and
impairment of our ability to conduct business effectively We depend heavily upon computer systems and mathematical algorithms and data to perform necessary business functions. Despite our
implementation of a variety of security measures, our computer systems could be subject to cyber-attacks and unauthorized access, such as physical and electronic break-ins or unauthorized tampering.
Like other global companies, we have experienced threats to our data and systems, including malware and computer virus attacks, unauthorized access, system failures and disruptions. Events such as
these could jeopardize the confidential, proprietary and other information (including personal information of our customers, claimants or employees) processed and stored in, and transmitted through,
our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations, which could result in damage to our reputation, financial losses, litigation, increased costs,
regulatory penalties and/or customer dissatisfaction or loss. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to expand our internet and mobile strategies, develop additional remote connectivity
solutions to serve our customers, and build and maintain an integrated digital enterprise. The
occurrence of a disaster, such as a natural catastrophe, pandemic, industrial accident, blackout, terrorist attack, war, cyber-attack, computer virus, insider threat, unanticipated
problems with our disaster recovery systems, or a support failure from external providers, could have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business and on our results of operations and
financial condition, particularly if those events affect our computer-based data processing, transmission, storage, and retrieval systems or destroy data. If a significant number of our managers were
unavailable in the event of a disaster, our ability to effectively conduct our business could be severely compromised. Third
parties to whom we outsource certain of our functions are also subject to the risks outlined above. The Company also has business process and information technology operations in
Northern Ireland and India and is subject to operating, regulatory and political risks in those countries. Any of these may result in our incurring substantial costs and other negative consequences,
including a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. A large scale pandemic, the continued threat of terrorism or military actions may have an adverse
effect on the level of claim losses we incur, the value of our investment portfolio, our competitive position, marketability of product offerings, liquidity and operating results A large scale pandemic, the continued threat of terrorism, within the United States and abroad, or military and other actions, and
heightened security measures in response to these types of threats, may cause significant volatility and losses in our investment portfolio from declines in the equity markets and from interest rate
changes in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, and result in loss of life, property damage, disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. Some of the assets in our investment portfolio
may be adversely affected by declines in the equity markets and reduced economic activity caused by a large scale pandemic or the continued threat of terrorism. Additionally, a large scale pandemic or
terrorist act could have a material effect on the sales, profitability, competitiveness, marketability of product offerings, liquidity, and operating results. We may be required to recognize impairments in the value of our goodwill, which may adversely affect
our operating results and financial condition Goodwill represents the excess of amounts paid for acquiring businesses over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is
evaluated for impairment annually, or more frequently if conditions warrant, by comparing the 23 Table of Contents carrying
value (attributed equity) of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value. Market declines or other events impacting the fair value of a reporting unit could result in a goodwill impairment,
resulting in a charge to income. Such a charge could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Changes in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other
standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition Our financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles, which are periodically revised,
interpreted and/or expanded. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new guidance or interpretations, or could be subject to existing guidance as we enter into new transactions, which may have a
material effect on our results of operations and financial condition that is either unexpected or has a greater impact than expected. For a description of changes in accounting standards that are
currently pending and, if known, our estimates of their expected impact, see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. The realization of deferred tax assets is subject to uncertainty The realization of our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, if any, is based on our assumption that we will be able to
fully utilize the deductions that are ultimately recognized for tax purposes. However, actual results may differ from our assumptions if adequate levels of taxable income are not attained. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends may affect our liquidity and ability to meet our
obligations The Allstate Corporation is a holding company with no significant operations. The principal asset is the stock of its subsidiaries.
State insurance regulatory authorities limit the payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries, as described in Note 16 of the consolidated financial statements. The limitations are based on
statutory income and surplus. In addition, competitive pressures generally require the subsidiaries to maintain insurance financial strength ratings. These restrictions and other regulatory
requirements affect the ability of the subsidiaries to make dividend payments. Limits on the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends could adversely affect holding company liquidity, including
our ability to pay dividends to shareholders, service our debt, or complete share repurchase programs in the timeframe expected. Management
views enterprise economic capital as a combination of statutory surplus and invested assets at the parent holding company level. Deterioration in statutory surplus or
earnings, from developments such as catastrophe losses, or changes in market conditions or interest rates, could adversely affect holding company
liquidity by impacting the amount of dividends from our subsidiaries or the utilization of invested assets at the holding company to increase statutory surplus or for other corporate purposes. Our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our stock is subject to limitations under terms of
certain of our securities Subject to certain limited exceptions, during any dividend period while our preferred stock is outstanding, unless the full preferred
stock dividends for the preceding dividend period have been declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside and any declared but unpaid preferred stock
dividends for any prior period have been paid, we may not repurchase or pay dividends on our common stock. If and when dividends on our preferred stock have not been declared and paid in full for at
least six quarterly dividend periods, the authorized number of directors then constituting our board of directors will be increased by two additional directors, to be elected by the holders of our
preferred stock together with the holders of all other affected classes and series of voting parity stock, voting as a single class, subject to certain conditions. We
are prohibited from declaring or paying dividends on our preferred stock if we fail to meet specified capital adequacy, net income or shareholders' equity levels. The prohibition is
subject to an exception permitting us to declare dividends out of the net proceeds of common stock issued by us during the 90 days prior to the date of declaration even if we fail to meet such
levels. The
terms of our outstanding subordinated debentures also prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on our common or preferred stock or redeeming, purchasing,
acquiring, or making liquidation payments on our common stock or preferred stock if we have elected to defer interest payments on the subordinated debentures, subject to certain limited exceptions. Changing climate conditions may adversely affect our financial condition, profitability or cash
flows Climate change, to the extent it produces changes in weather patterns, could affect the frequency or severity of weather events and
wildfires, the affordability and availability of homeowners insurance, and the results for our Allstate Protection segment. 24 Table of Contents Loss of key vendor relationships or failure of a vendor to protect our data or personal information
of our customers, claimants or employees could affect our operations We rely on services and products provided by many vendors in the United States and abroad. These include, for example, vendors of
computer hardware and software and vendors of services such as claim adjustment services, human resource benefits management services and investment management services. In the event that one or more
of our vendors suffers a bankruptcy or otherwise becomes unable to continue to provide products or services, or fails to protect our data or personal information of our customers, claimants or
employees, we may suffer operational impairments and financial losses. We may not be able to protect our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims We rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our
intellectual property. Although we use a broad range of measures to protect our intellectual property rights, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property. We may have to
litigate to enforce and protect our intellectual property and to determine its scope, validity or enforceability, which could divert significant resources and prove unsuccessful. An inability to
protect our intellectual property could have a material effect on our business. We
may be subject to claims by third parties for patent, trademark or copyright infringement or breach of usage rights. Any such claims and any resulting litigation could result in
significant expense and liability. If our third party providers or we are found to have infringed a third-party intellectual property right, either of us could be enjoined from providing certain
products or services or from utilizing and benefiting from certain methods, processes, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or licenses. Alternatively, we could be required to enter into costly
licensing arrangements with third parties or implement a costly work around. Any of these scenarios could have a material effect on our business and results of operations.
