Business General The Company. Ameriana Bancorp (the Company) is an Indiana chartered bank holding company subject to regulation and
supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve Board) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the BHCA). The Company became the holding company for Ameriana Bank (the
Bank) in 1990. The Company also holds a minority interest in a limited partnership organized to acquire and manage real estate investments, which qualify for federal tax credits. References to we, us and
our refer to Ameriana Bancorp and/or the Bank, as appropriate. The Bank. The Bank began operations in 1890. Since
1935, the Bank has been a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (the FHLB) System. Its deposits are insured to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund, administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the
FDIC). On June 29, 2002, the Bank converted to an Indiana savings bank and adopted the name Ameriana Bank and Trust, SB. On July 31, 2006, the Bank closed its Trust Department and adopted the name Ameriana Bank,
SB. On June 1, 2009, the Bank converted from an Indiana savings bank to an Indiana commercial bank and adopted its present name, Ameriana Bank. The Bank is subject to regulation by the Indiana Department of Financial
Institutions (the DFI) and the FDIC. The Bank conducts business through its main office at 2118 Bundy Avenue, New Castle, Indiana and through 13 branch offices located in New Castle, Middletown, Knightstown, Morristown, Greenfield,
Anderson, Avon, Carmel, New Palestine, Westfield, Noblesville and two branches in Fishers, Indiana. The Bank offers a wide range of consumer and commercial banking services, including: (1) accepting deposits; (2) originating commercial,
mortgage, consumer and construction loans; and (3) through its subsidiaries, providing investment and brokerage services and insurance services. The Bank has two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Ameriana Insurance Agency (AIA) and Ameriana Financial Services, Inc.
(AFS). AIA provides insurance sales from offices in New Castle, Greenfield and Avon, Indiana. AFS operates a brokerage business in conjunction with LPL Financial that provides non-bank investment product alternatives to its customers and
the general public. The principal sources of funds for the Banks lending activities include deposits received from the general
public, funds borrowed from the FHLB of Indianapolis, principal amortization and prepayment of loans. The Banks primary sources of income are interest and fees on loans and interest on investments. The Bank has from 1 Table of Contents time to time purchased loans and loan participations in the secondary market. The Bank also invests in various federal and government agency obligations and other investment securities permitted
by applicable laws and regulations, including mortgage-backed, municipal and mutual fund securities. The Banks principal expenses are interest paid on deposit accounts and borrowed funds and operating expenses. Competition. The geographic markets we serve are highly competitive for deposits, loans and other financial services, including retail
brokerage services and insurance. Our direct competitors include traditional banking and savings institutions, as well as other non-bank providers of financial services, such as insurance companies, brokerage firms, mortgage companies and credit
unions located in the Banks market area. Additional significant competition for deposits comes from money market mutual funds and corporate and government debt securities, and Internet banks. The primary factors in competing for loans are interest rates and loan origination fees, and the range of services offered by the various
financial institutions. Competition for origination of loans normally comes from commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage bankers, mortgage brokers and insurance companies. The Bank has banking offices in Henry, Hancock, Hendricks, Shelby, Madison, and Hamilton Counties in Indiana. The Bank competes with numerous
commercial banks and savings institutions in the Banks primary service areas and in surrounding counties, many of which have capital and assets that are substantially larger than the Bank. The Company expects competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing
trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Technological advances, for example, have lowered barriers to entry into the industry, allowed banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the Internet and made it
possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally have been provided by banks. Changes in federal law permit affiliation among banks, securities firms and insurance companies, which promotes a competitive
environment in the financial services industry. Competition for deposits and the origination of loans could limit the Companys growth in the future. Available Information The Companys
annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to such reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are

Companys website should not be considered a part of this Form 10-K. Lending Activities General. The principal lending activity of the Bank has been the origination of conventional first mortgage loans secured by residential
property and commercial real estate, and commercial loans and consumer loans. The residential mortgage loans have been predominantly secured by single-family homes and have included construction loans. The majority of the Banks mortgage loan portfolio is secured by real estate located in Henry, Hancock, Hamilton, Hendricks, Madison,
Shelby, Delaware and Marion Counties in Indiana. 2 Table of Contents The following table sets forth information concerning the Banks loans by type of loan at
the dates indicated.

contractual terms to maturity. Demand loans, loans having no stated schedule of repayments and no stated maturity and overdrafts are reported as due in one year or less. Contractual principal repayments of loans do not necessarily reflect the actual
term of the loan portfolio. The average life of mortgage loans is substantially less than their contractual terms because of loan prepayments and because of enforcement of due-on-sale clauses, which give the Bank the right to declare a loan
immediately due and payable if, among other things, the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid. The average life of mortgage loans tends to increase, however, when current mortgage loan rates
substantially exceed rates on existing mortgage loans. Amounts of Loans Which Mature in 2015 2016  2019 2020 and Thereafter Total (In thousands) Type of Loan: Residential and commercial real estate mortgage $ 18,716 $ 90,346 $ 166,232 $ 275,294 Construction 6,572 4,788 2,210 13,570 Other 8,573 19,019 4,569 32,161 Total $ 33,861 $ 114,153 $ 173,011 $ 321,025 The following table sets forth the dollar amount of the Companys aggregate loans due after one year from
December 31, 2014, which have predetermined interest rates and which have floating or adjustable interest rates. Fixed Rate Adjustable Rate Total (In thousands) Residential and commercial real estate mortgage $ 199,098 $ 57,480 $ 256,578 Construction 4,160 2,838 6,998 Other loans 14,665 8,923 23,588 Total $ 217,923 $ 69,241 $ 287,164 Residential Real Estate and Residential Construction Lending. The Bank originates loans on one-to
four-family residences. The original contractual loan payment period for residential mortgage loans originated by the Bank generally ranges from ten to 30 years. Because borrowers may refinance or prepay their loans, they normally remain outstanding
for a shorter period. The Bank normally sells a portion of its newly originated fixed-rate mortgage loans in the secondary market and retains all adjustable-rate loans in its portfolio. The decision to sell fixed-rate mortgage loans is determined by
management based on available pricing and balance sheet considerations. The Bank also originates hybrid mortgage loans. Hybrid mortgage loans carry a fixed-rate for the first three to five years, and then convert to an adjustable-rate thereafter.
The residential mortgage loans originated and retained by the Bank in 2014 were composed primarily of fixed-rate loans and, to a lesser extent, one-year adjustable rate loans and hybrid loans that have a fixed-rate for three years and adjust
annually to the one-year constant maturity treasury rate thereafter. The overall strategy is to maintain a low risk mortgage portfolio that helps to diversify the Banks overall asset mix. The Bank makes construction/permanent loans to borrowers to build one-to four-family owner-occupied residences with terms of up to 30 years.
These loans are made as interest-only loans for a period typically of 12 months, at which time the loan converts to an amortized loan for the remaining term. The loans are typically made as adjustable-rate mortgages. One-to four-family residential
construction loans were $3.8 million, or 28.2% of the construction loan portfolio, at December 31, 2014 compared to $2.6 million, or 22.9%, at December 31, 2013. Additionally, at December 31, 2014, the Bank held loans on $758,000 of
residential land and building lots, which represented 5.6% of the construction loan portfolio, compared to $820,000, or 7.2%, at December 31, 2013. Loans involving construction financing present a greater level of risk than loans for the purchase of existing homes since collateral value
and construction costs can only be estimated at the time the loan is approved. The Bank has sought to minimize this risk by limiting construction lending to qualified borrowers in its market area and by limiting the number of construction loans
outstanding at any time to individual builders. In addition, many of the Banks construction loans are made on homes that are pre-sold, for which permanent financing is already arranged. 4 Table of Contents Home equity lines of credit have adjustable rates of interest that are indexed to the
prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal for terms of up to 10 years. The loans are originated with a total maximum loan-to-value ratio of 85% (including the first mortgage) of the appraised value of the property, and the Bank
requires that it has a second lien position on the property. In 2014, the Bank originated $32.5 million in non-construction
residential real estate loans. The total included $3.7 million in adjustable-rate residential first mortgage loans, including hybrids, $25.7 million of fixed-rate first mortgage loans, $2.9 million of home equity credit lines and $285,000 of closed
end second mortgage loans. Fixed-rate residential mortgage loans sold into the secondary market in 2014 and 2013 were $4.7 million and $14.9 million, respectively. Gains on residential loan sales, including imputed gains on servicing rights and loan
origination fees net of direct origination costs, were $170,000 in 2014 compared with $511,000 in 2013. Commercial Real Estate and
Commercial Real Estate Construction Lending. The Bank originates loans secured by both owner-occupied and nonowner-occupied properties. The Bank originates commercial real estate loans and purchases loan participations from other financial
institutions. These participations are reviewed and approved based upon the same credit standards as commercial real estate loans originated by the Bank. At December 31, 2014, the Banks individual commercial real estate loan balances
ranged from $1,000 to $4.2 million. The Banks commercial real estate loans may have a fixed or variable interest rate. Loans
secured by commercial real estate properties are generally larger and involve a greater degree of credit risk than one-to four-family residential mortgage loans. Because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate properties are often
dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties, repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or by general economic conditions. If the cash flows from the project are reduced (for
example, if leases are not obtained or renewed), the borrowers ability to repay the loan may be impaired. To minimize the risks involved in originating such loans, the Bank considers, among other things, the creditworthiness of the borrower,
the location of the real estate, the condition and occupancy levels of the security, the projected cash flows of the business, the borrowers ability to service the debt and the quality of the organization managing the property. Commercial real estate construction loans are made to developers for the construction of commercial properties, owner-occupied facilities,
nonowner-occupied facilities and for speculative purposes. These construction loans are granted based on a reasonable estimate of the time to complete the projects. Commercial real estate construction loans made up $9.0 million, or 66.2% of the
construction loan portfolio, at December 31, 2014 compared to $8.0 million, or 69.9%, at December 31, 2013. As these loans mature they will either pay-off or roll to a permanent commercial real estate loan. The Banks underwriting criteria are designed to evaluate and minimize the risks of each construction loan. Among other things, the Bank
considers evidence of the availability of permanent financing or a takeout commitment to the borrower; the reputation of the borrower and his or her financial condition; the amount of the borrowers equity in the project; independent appraisal
and review of cost estimates; pre-construction sale and leasing information; cash flow projections of the borrower; and the number of other active construction projects a borrower has ongoing. At December 31, 2014, the largest commercial real estate lending relationship was comprised of five loans to five separate borrowing
entities with a total commitment of $9.0 million and a total outstanding balance of $8.7 million. All five loans were secured by retail strip shopping centers, and were performing according to their original terms at December 31, 2014. Municipal Lending. At December 31, 2014, the Banks loan portfolio included two municipal loans with approved credit limits
totaling $785,000 outstanding balances totaling $785,000. Consumer Lending. The consumer lending portfolio includes
automobile loans and other consumer products. The collateral is generally the asset defined in the purpose of the request. The policies of the Bank are adhered to in our underwriting of consumer loans. 5 Table of Contents Management believes that the shorter terms and the normally higher interest rates available on
various types of consumer loans have been helpful in maintaining profitable spreads between average loan yields and costs of funds. Consumer loans may entail greater risk than do residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans
that are unsecured or secured by assets that depreciate rapidly. In such cases, repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan and the remaining deficiency often does not
warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. In addition, consumer loan collections depend on the borrowers continuing financial stability, and therefore, are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce,
illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans. The Bank has sought to reduce this
risk by primarily granting secured consumer loans. Commercial Lending. The Bank lends to business entities for the short-term
working capital, inventory financing, equipment purchases and other business financing needs. The loans can be in the form of revolving lines of credit, commercial lines of credit or term debt. The Bank also matches the term of the debt to the
estimated useful life of the assets. At December 31, 2014, the largest commercial relationship included seven credits with a
total commitment of $6.7 million and outstanding balances totaling $4.9 million that were secured by business assets of the borrower. One of the credits with a $5.0 million commitment and outstanding balance of $3.9 million was approved under the
Small Business Administration (SBA) 7(a) CAPLine program and carries a 75% SBA guarantee. All of the individual credits were performing according to their original terms at December 31, 2014. Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrowers ability to make repayment from his or her
employment or other income, and which are secured by real property the value of which tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial loans are of higher risk and typically are made on the basis of the borrowers ability to make repayment
from the cash flows of the borrowers business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial loans may depend substantially on the success of the business itself. Further, any collateral securing such loans may
depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value. Originations, Purchases and Sales. Historically,
most residential and commercial real estate loans have been originated directly by the Bank through salaried and commissioned loan officers. Residential loan originations have been attributable to referrals from real estate brokers and builders, and
banking center staff. In 2014, the Bank acquired a $254,000 loan on vacant commercial land and four residential property loans totaling $155,000 from the Indianapolis Neighborhood Housing Partnership, a 23-year-old independent, non-governmental
nonprofit that helps families and individuals become long-term, successful homeowners. At December 31, 2014, balances outstanding for all loan participations or whole loan purchases totaled $13.3 million. Commercial real estate and construction
loan originations have also been obtained by direct solicitation. Consumer loan originations are attributable to walk-in customers who have been made aware of the Banks programs by advertising as well as direct solicitation. The Bank has previously sold whole loans and loan participations to other financial institutions and institutional investors, and sold $4.7
million of fixed-rate single-family mortgage loans in 2014. Sales of loans generate income (or loss) at the time of sale, produce future servicing income and provide funds for additional lending and other purposes. When the Bank retains the
servicing of loans it sells, the Bank retains responsibility for collecting and remitting loan payments, inspecting the properties, making certain insurance and tax payments on behalf of borrowers and otherwise servicing those loans. The Bank
typically receives a fee of between 0.25% and 0.375% per annum of the loans principal amount for performing these services. The right to service a loan has economic value and the Bank carries capitalized servicing rights on its books
based on comparable market values and expected cash flows. At December 31, 2014, the Bank was servicing $70.9 million of loans for others. The aggregate book value of capitalized servicing rights at December 31, 2014 was $530,000. Management believes that purchases of loans and loan participations are desirable when local mortgage demand is less than the local supply of
funds available for mortgage originations or when loan terms available outside the Banks local lending areas are favorable to those available locally. Additionally, purchases of loans may be made to diversify the Banks lending portfolio.
The Banks loan purchasing activities fluctuate significantly. The seller generally performs the servicing of purchased loans. The Bank utilizes the same underwriting and monitoring processes and standards for loans it purchases as it would for
internally generated loans. To cover 6 Table of Contents servicing costs, the service provider retains a portion of the interest being paid by the borrower. In addition to whole loan purchases, the Bank also purchases participation interests in loans.
Both whole loans and participations are purchased on a yield basis. For additional information, see  Managements
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Loan Underwriting. During the loan approval process, the Bank assesses both the borrowers ability to repay the loan and the
adequacy of the underlying security. Potential residential borrowers complete an application that is submitted to a commissioned loan originator. As part of the loan application process, the Bank obtains information concerning the income, financial
condition, employment and credit history of the applicant. In addition, qualified appraisers inspect and appraise the property that is offered to secure the loan. The Banks underwriter or the Senior Vice President of Mortgage Banking approves
or denies the loan request. Consumer loan applications are evaluated using a multi-factor based scoring system or by direct
underwriting. Commercial loans that are part of a lending relationship exceeding $250,000 are submitted to the Banks credit
analysts for review, financial analysis and for preparation of a Loan Approval Memorandum. The Loan Committee, consisting of members of the Board or management appointed by the Board of Directors, must approve secured and unsecured loans over
$500,000 and $100,000, respectively, and all loans that have a variance to loan policy. In connection with the origination of
single-family, residential adjustable-rate loans with the initial rate fixed for five years or less, borrowers are qualified at a rate of interest equal to the new rate at the first re-pricing date, assuming the maximum increase. It is the policy of
management to make loans to borrowers who not only qualify at the low initial rate of interest, but who would also qualify following an upward interest rate adjustment. Loan Fee and Servicing Income. In addition to interest earned on loans, the Bank receives income through servicing of loans, and fees
in connection with loan originations, loan modifications, late payments, changes of property ownership and for other miscellaneous services related to the loan. Income from these activities is volatile and varies from period to period with the
volume and type of loans made. When possible, the Bank charges loan origination fees on commercial loans that are calculated as a
percentage of the amount borrowed and are charged to the borrower at the time of origination of the loan. These fees generally range up to one point (one point being equivalent to 1% of the principal amount of the loan). In accordance with
Accounting Standards Codification 310, loan origination and commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and the net amount amortized as an adjustment of yield over the contractual life of the related loans. For additional information, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Delinquencies. When a borrower defaults on a required payment on a non-commercial loan, the Bank contacts the borrower and
attempts to induce the borrower to cure the default. A late payment notice is mailed to the borrower and a telephone contact is made after a payment is fifteen days past due. If the delinquency on a mortgage loan exceeds 90 days and is not cured
through the Banks normal collection procedures or an acceptable arrangement is not worked out with the borrower, the Bank will institute measures to remedy the default, including commencing foreclosure action. In the case of default related to
a commercial loan, the contact is initiated by the commercial lender after a payment is ten days past due. The Loan Committee reviews delinquency reports weekly and the Criticized Assets Committee reviews classified delinquent loans quarterly. The Bank follows the collection processes required by Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis to
manage residential loans underwritten for the secondary market. The collection practices for all other loans adhere with the Banks loan policies and regulatory requirements. It is the Banks intention to be proactive in its collection of
delinquent accounts while adhering to state and federal guidelines. 7 Table of Contents Nonperforming Assets and Asset Classification. Loans are reviewed regularly and are placed
on nonaccrual status when, in the opinion of management, the collection of additional interest is doubtful. Residential mortgage loans are placed on nonaccrual status when principal or interest payments are 90 days or more past due unless it is
adequately secured and there is reasonable assurance of full collection of principal and interest. Consumer loans generally are charged off when the loan delinquency exceeds 120 days. Commercial real estate loans and commercial loans are generally
placed on nonaccrual status when the loan is 90 days or more past due. Interest accrued and unpaid at the time a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is charged against interest income. Subsequent payments are applied to the outstanding principal
balance. Real estate acquired by the Bank as a result of foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is classified as real
estate owned until such time as it is sold. When such property is acquired, it is recorded at its fair value. Any subsequent deterioration of the property is charged off directly to income, reducing the value of the asset. The following table sets forth information with respect to the Companys aggregate nonperforming assets at the dates indicated. At December 31, 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 (Dollars in thousands) Loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis: Real Estate: Residential $ 2,212 $ 2,767 $ 3,903 $ 4,500 $ 6,258 Commercial 812 351 354   Construction 836 1,207 2,375 3,432 4,184 Commercial loans and leases 516 733 967 644 731 Consumer loans   4  14 Total 4,376 5,058 7,603 8,576 11,187 Accruing loans contractually past due 90 days or more: Real Estate: Residential 14 9  243 60 Consumer loans 1  1 9  Total 15 9 1 252 60 Total of nonaccrual and 90 days or more past due loans (1) $ 4,391 $ 5,067 $ 7,604 $ 8,828 $ 11,247 Percentage of total loans 1.37 % 1.60 % 2.39 % 2.79 % 3.54 % Other nonperforming assets (2) $ 6,639 $ 5,171 $ 6,326 $ 7,571 $ 9,082 Total nonperforming assets $ 11,030 $ 10,238 $ 13,930 $ 16,399 $ 20,329 Percentage of total assets 2.33 % 2.23 % 3.13 % 3.82 % 4.73 % Troubled debt restructurings in total of nonaccrual and 90 days or more past due loans (1) $ 1,082 $ 1,781 $ 2,750 $ 1,783 $ 2,245 Total troubled debt restructurings $ 7,455 $ 11,558 $ 12,171 $ 9,016 $ 8,393 (1) Total nonaccrual loans and 90 days or more past due loans at December 31, 2014 included $1.1 million of troubled debt restructurings, which consisted of four residential real estate loans totaling $885,000 and
three commercial loans totaling $197,000. (2) Other nonperforming assets represent property acquired through foreclosure or repossession. This property is carried at the lower of its fair market value or the principal balance of the related loan. In a slowly improving local economy the Company has continued to make progress in reducing nonperforming loans, with $4.4 million at
December 31, 2014 representing a $676,000 reduction from $5.1 million at December 31, 2013. Nonaccrual residential real estate loans decreased $555,000 for the year to $2.2 million at December 31, 2014, primarily the result of the
repurchase by the servicer of a loan with a $781,000 balance at 8 Table of Contents December 31, 2013. Nonaccrual construction loans decreased by $371,000 during 2014, as the property securing all three nonaccrual loans totaling $1.2 million at December 31, 2013 was
transferred to other real estate owned, partly offset by the addition of one nonaccrual loan for $836,000 at December 31, 2014. Our nonaccrual commercial loans declined $217,000 during 2014 to $516,000 from $733,000 at December 31, 2013.
There was one nonaccrual commercial real estate loan with a balance of $812,000 at December 31, 2014, an increase of $460,000 over the amount for one loan a year earlier. We have analyzed our collateral position on these nonperforming loans
using current appraisals and valuations, and have established reserves accordingly. Troubled debt restructurings (TDRs)
decreased $4.1 million from $11.6 million at December 31, 2013 to $7.5 million at December 31, 2014. The decrease was the net result of the payoff of six loans totaling $3.0 million at December 31, 2013, the transfer to other real
estate owned of a $1.0 million loan, partly offset by one new TDR with a balance of $164,000 and other payments applied to loan principal. The total of $7.5 million at December 31, 2014 included a $3.7 million loan on a hotel in northern
Indiana, a $940,000 loan for developed commercial land, 20 single-family home loans totaling $2.6 million and three commercial loans totaling $197,000. As of December 31, 2014, the Bank had classified $1.1 million of the TDRs as doubtful,
including the three commercial loans and four single-family home loans. The $940,000 loan for developed commercial land and 12 single-family home loans totaling $1.3 million were classified as pass. The other TDRs totaling $4.1 million were
classified as substandard. The total of $11.6 million at December 31, 2013 included a $3.8 million loan on the hotel in northern Indiana, a $1.0 million construction loan on a residential condominium project, 23 single-family home loans
totaling $4.0 million, two loans totaling $2.5 million for developed commercial land, three commercial loans totaling $264,000, and a commercial real estate loan for $24,000. Other nonperforming assets, real estate acquired through foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, totaled $6.6 million at December 31,
2014. The properties consisted of a strip retail center and outlot with a book value of $2.0 million, a residential condominium development project with a book value of $1.5 million, 4 single-family homes totaling $961,000, 2 parcels of land zoned
commercial totaling $820,000, 40 single-family lots in 4 developments totaling $607,000, 2 parcels of undeveloped land zoned residential totaling $366,000 and 3 commercial properties totaling $363,000. Interest income that would have been recorded for 2014 had non-accruing loans been current in accordance with their original terms and had
been outstanding throughout the period was $432,000. The amount of interest related to those nonaccrual loans included in interest income for 2014 was $91,000. For additional information regarding the Banks problem assets and loss provisions recorded thereon, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Form 10-K. Reserves for Losses on Loans and Real Estate In making loans, management recognizes that credit losses will be experienced and that the risk of loss will vary with, among other things, the
type of loan being made, the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan and, in the case of a secured loan, the quality of the security for the loan. It is managements policy to maintain reserves for estimated incurred losses on loans. The Banks management establishes general
loan loss reserves based on, among other things, historical loan loss experience, evaluation of economic conditions in general and in various sectors of the Banks customer base, and periodic reviews of loan portfolio quality. Specific reserves
are provided for individual loans where the ultimate collection is considered questionable by management after reviewing the current status of loans that are contractually past due and considering the net realizable value of the security of the loan
or guarantees, if applicable. It is managements policy to establish specific reserves for estimated inherent losses on delinquent loans when it determines that losses are anticipated to be incurred on the underlying properties. At
December 31, 2014, the Banks allowance for loan losses amounted to $3.9 million. Management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover all incurred and probable losses inherent in the portfolio at December 31,
2014. Future reserves may be necessary if economic conditions or other circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in
making the initial determinations. Regulators, in reviewing the Banks loan portfolio, may require the Bank to increase its allowance for loan losses, thereby negatively affecting its financial condition and earnings. 9 Table of Contents The following table sets forth an analysis of the Banks aggregate allowance for loan losses
for the periods indicated: Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 (Dollars in thousands) Balance at beginning of period $ 3,993 $ 4,239 $ 4,132 $ 4,212 $ 4,005 Charge-offs: Real estate loans: Commercial 106 479 53 11 238 Residential 204 441 456 605 737 Construction 46 2 196 536 525 Commercial loans 59 137 324 301 398 Consumer loans 90 81 69 107 72 Total charge-offs 505 1,140 1,098 1,560 1,970 Recoveries: Real estate loans: Commercial 11   1  Residential 13 42 21 76 16 Construction 4 21 8 1 206 Commercial loans and leases 31 38 4 2 4 Consumer loans 34 38 27 15 18 Total recoveries 93 139 60 95 244 Net charge-offs (412 ) (1,001 ) (1,038 ) (1,465 ) (1,726 ) Provision for loan losses 322 755 1,145 1,385 1,933 Balance at end of period $ 3,903 $ 3,993 $ 4,239 $ 4,132 $ 4,212 Ratio of net charge-offs to average loan outstanding during the period 0.13 % 0.31 % 0.33 % 0.47 % 0.54 % Allowance for loan losses to non-performing Loans 88.89 % 78.80 % 55.75 % 46.81 % 37.45 % Allowance for loan losses to total loans 1.22 % 1.26 % 1.33 % 1.30 % 1.33 % The Company had a provision for loan losses of $322,000 for 2014 compared to a provision of $755,000 in 2013.
The lower 2014 provision was due primarily to a reduction in nonperforming loans and net charge-offs, and to an improvement in the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio. Total charge-offs were $505,000 for 2014, and included partial charge-offs totaling $184,000 to three loans related to an interior
decorating business, $185,000 to seven residential real estate loans, $46,000 to two construction loans, and $90,000 to consumer loans. Charge-offs totaled $1.1 million for 2013, and included a partial charge-off of $479,000 of a loan on a hotel in
northern Indiana, $441,000 to 16 residential real estate loans, and $137,000 to five commercial loans. These charge-offs resulted primarily from the continued effects of the recent economic downturn and slow recovery of the local economy, and were
based on new appraisals or new valuations. See also Item 7.  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Loans  Credit Quality . 10 Table of Contents The following table sets forth a breakdown of the Companys aggregate allowance for loan
losses by loan category at the dates indicated. Management believes that the allowance can be allocated by category only on an approximate basis. The allocation of the allowance to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses and
does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any category.

of income for the Bank (after interest on loans), constituting 8.4% of the Banks total interest income (and dividends) for 2014. The Bank maintains its liquid assets at levels believed adequate to meet requirements of normal banking activities
and potential savings outflows. As an Indiana commercial bank, the Bank is authorized to invest without limitation in direct or indirect
obligations of the United States, direct obligations of a United States territory, and direct obligations of the state or a municipal corporation or taxing district in Indiana. The Bank is also permitted to invest in bonds or other securities of a
national mortgage association and the stock and obligations of a Federal Home Loan Bank. Indiana commercial banks may also invest in collateralized mortgage obligations to the same extent as national banks. An Indiana commercial bank may also
purchase for its own account other investment securities under such limits as the Department of Financial Institutions prescribes by rule, provided that the commercial bank may not invest more than 10% of its equity capital in the investment
securities of any one issuer. An Indiana commercial bank may not invest in speculative bonds, notes or other indebtedness that are defined as securities and that are rated below the first four rating categories by a generally recognized rating
service, or are in default. An Indiana commercial bank may purchase an unrated security if it obtains financial information adequate to document the investment quality of the security. The Banks investment portfolio consists primarily of mortgage-backed securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The
Bank has also invested in municipal securities and mutual funds and maintains interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions (primarily the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and the FHLB of Indianapolis). As a member of the FHLB System, the
Bank is also required to hold stock in the FHLB of Indianapolis. The Bank did not own any security of a single issuer that had an aggregate book value in excess of 10% of its equity at December 31, 2014. 11 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the amortized cost and fair value of the Banks investments

Sources of Funds General. Checking and savings accounts, certificates of deposit and other types of deposits are an important source of the Banks
funds for use in lending and for other general business purposes. In addition to deposit accounts, the Bank derives funds from loan repayments, loan sales, borrowings and operations. The availability of funds from loan sales and repayments is
influenced by general interest rates and other market conditions. Borrowings may be used short-term to compensate for reductions in deposits or deposit inflows at less than projected levels and may be used on a longer-term basis to support expanded
lending activities. Deposits. The Bank attracts both short-term and long-term retail deposits from the general public by
offering a wide assortment of deposit accounts and interest rates. The Bank offers regular savings accounts, interest-bearing (NOW) and noninterest-bearing checking accounts, money market accounts, fixed interest rate certificates with varying
maturities and negotiated rate jumbo certificates with various maturities. The Bank also offers tax-deferred individual retirement, Keogh retirement and simplified employer plan retirement accounts. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 63.8%, or $241.9 million, of the Banks aggregate deposits consisted of various savings and
demand deposit accounts from which customers are permitted to withdraw funds at any time without penalty. Interest earned on statement
accounts is paid from the date of deposit to the date of withdrawal and compounded semi-annually for the Bank. Interest earned on NOW and money market deposit accounts is paid from the date of deposit to the date of withdrawal and compounded and
credited monthly. Management establishes the interest rates on these accounts weekly, or as often as necessary to be competitive. The
Bank also makes available to its depositors a number of certificates of deposit with various terms and interest rates to be competitive in its market area. These certificates have minimum deposit requirements as well. In addition to retail deposits, the Bank may obtain certificates of deposit from the brokered market. The Bank held no brokered certificates
at December 31, 2014 and 2013. 13 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the change in dollar amount of deposits in the various types of
deposit accounts offered by the Bank between the dates indicated, with fixed-rate certificates categorized by original term to maturity: Balance at Balance at December 31, December 31, 2014 2013 Increase (Decrease) (Dollars in thousands) Noninterest-bearing deposits $ 61,063 16.11 % $ 52,747 14.54 % $ 8,316 15.77 % Interest-bearing checking 112,899 29.79 98,234 27.09 14,665 14.93 Money market deposits 34,960 9.23 36,125 9.96 (1,165 ) (3.23 ) Savings deposits 32,997 8.71 30,009 8.28 2,988 9.96 Certificate accounts: Certificates of $100,000 and more 46,157 12.18 51,188 14.11 (5,031 ) (9.83 ) Fixed-rate certificates: 12 months or less 20,487 5.40 22,970 6.33 (2,483 ) (10.81 ) 13-24 months 19,202 5.07 21,265 5.86 (2,063 ) (9.70 ) 25-36 months 15,396 4.06 14,937 4.12 459 3.07 37 months or greater 35,191 9.29 34,640 9.55 551 1.59 Variable-rate certificates: 18 months 595 0.16 586 0.16 9 1.54 Total $ 378,947 100.00 % $ 362,701 100.00 % $ 16,246 4.48 The variety of deposit accounts offered by the Bank has permitted it to be competitive in obtaining funds and
has allowed it to respond with flexibility to, but not eliminate, disintermediation (the flow of funds away from depository institutions such as savings institutions into direct investment vehicles such as government and corporate securities). In
addition, the Bank has become increasingly subject to short-term fluctuation in deposit flows, as customers have become more interest rate conscious. The ability of the Bank to attract and maintain deposits and its costs of funds have been, and will
continue to be, significantly affected by money market conditions. The Bank currently offers a variety of deposit products, including noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing NOW accounts, savings accounts, money market deposit accounts
(MMDA) and certificates of deposit ranging in terms from three months to seven years. The following table sets forth the
Banks average aggregate balances and interest rates. Average balances in 2014, 2013 and 2012 are calculated from actual daily balances.

Deposits are the primary sources of funds for the Banks lending and investment
activities and for its general business purposes. The Bank also uses advances from the FHLB to supplement its supply of lendable funds, to meet deposit withdrawal requirements and to extend the terms of its liabilities. FHLB advances are typically
secured by the Banks FHLB stock, a portion of first mortgage loans, investment securities and overnight deposits. At December 31, 2014, the Bank had $28.0 million of FHLB advances outstanding. The Federal Home Loan Banks function as central reserve banks providing credit for member financial institutions. As a member, the Bank is
required to own capital stock in the FHLB and is authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of its home mortgages and other assets (principally, securities which are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United
States) provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met. Borrowings decreased $5.0 million in 2014, as the Bank prepaid a Federal Home Loan Bank note that had been used to match-fund a ten-year commercial real estate loan in
2008. The Bank received a $651,000 prepayment penalty fee from the loan payoff and paid a $614,000 prepayment penalty to the Federal Home Loan Bank. Borrowings increased $5.0 million in 2013, as the Bank added a three-year Federal Home Loan Bank
note with an interest rate of 0.77% as partial funding of a leverage strategy that involved the purchase of $8.1 million of Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities. 15 Table of Contents On March 8, 2006, the Company formed Ameriana Capital Trust I (Trust I), a
wholly owned statutory business trust. The Company purchased 100% of the common stock of Trust I for $310,000. Trust I issued $10.0 million in trust preferred securities and those proceeds, combined with the $310,000 in proceeds of the common stock,
were used to purchase $10.3 million in subordinated debentures issued by the Company. The subordinated debentures are unconditionally guaranteed by the Company and are the sole asset of Trust I. The subordinated debentures had a rate equal to the
average of 6.71% and the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 150 basis points for the first five years following the offering. Effective March 15, 2011, the fixed rate converted to a floating rate and the
subordinated debentures now bear a rate equal to 150 basis points over the three-month LIBOR rate. At December 31, 2014, the debentures had an interest rate of 1.74%. The following table sets forth certain information regarding borrowings at the dates and for the periods indicated: At or for the Year Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 (Dollars in thousands) Amounts outstanding at end of period: FHLB advances $ 28,000 $ 33,000 $ 28,000 Subordinated debentures 10,310 10,310 10,310 Repurchase agreement 7,500 7,500 7,500 Weighted average rate paid on: FHLB advances at end of period (1) 2.17 % 2.54 % 2.83 % Subordinated debentures 1.74 1.74 1.81 Repurchase agreement 4.42 4.42 4.42 Maximum amount of borrowings outstanding at any month end: FHLB advances $ 33,000 $ 33,000 $ 28,000 Subordinated debentures 10,310 10,310 10,310 Repurchase agreement 7,500 7,500 7,500 Approximate average amounts outstanding during period: FHLB advances $ 32,677 $ 29,022 $ 28,054 Subordinated debentures 10,310 10,310 10,310 Repurchase agreement 7,500 7,500 7,500 Approximate weighted average rate during the period paid on: FHLB advances 2.52 % 2.82 % 3.45 % Subordinated debentures 1.74 1.80 1.99 Repurchase agreement 4.42 4.42 4.42 (1) The actual weighted average rate at December 31, 2014 was 1.10%, but the effective rate was 2.17%. The effective rate incorporates the impact on interest expense from the amortization of two prepayment penalties
totaling $1.5 million that resulted when two advances of $10.0 million each were replaced in 2012 with new borrowings that have lower rates and later maturity dates. 16 Table of Contents Average Balance Sheet The following table sets forth certain information relating to the Banks average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the
periods indicated. Such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expenses by the average balance of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods presented. Interest/dividends from tax-exempt municipal loans and tax-exempt municipal
securities have been increased by $60,000, $62,000 and $64,000 for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, from the amount listed on the income statement to reflect interest income on a tax-equivalent basis. Average balances for 2014, 2013 and 2012 are
calculated from actual daily balances.

The Company also holds a minority interest in a
limited partnership organized to acquire and manage real estate-investments, which qualify for federal tax credits. The Bank has two wholly owned subsidiaries: AIA, which sells insurance products and AFS, which operates a brokerage business. At
December 31, 2014, the Banks investments in its subsidiaries were approximately $1.7 million, consisting of direct equity investments. Indiana commercial banks may acquire or establish subsidiaries that engage in activities permitted to be performed by the commercial bank
itself, or permitted to operating subsidiaries of national banks. Under FDIC regulations, a subsidiary of a state bank may not engage as principal in any activity that is not of a type permissible for a subsidiary of a national bank unless the FDIC
determines that the activity does not impose a significant risk to the affected insurance fund. REGULATION AND SUPERVISION Certain of the regulatory requirements that are or will be applicable to the Company or the Bank are described below. The description of
statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete explanation of such statutes and regulations and their effects on the Company and the Bank and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual statutes and regulations. Regulation and Supervision of the Company General. As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to Federal Reserve Board regulations, examinations, supervision, reporting
requirements and regulations concerning its activities. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over the Company. As a public reporting company registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC),
the Company is required to file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. The Company is also subject to regular examination by the Federal Reserve Board. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 authorized a bank holding company that meets specified conditions, including its depository institution
subsidiaries being well-capitalized and well managed, to opt to become a financial holding company, and thereby engage in a broader array of financial activities than previously permitted. Such activities can include insurance
underwriting and investment banking. The Dodd-Frank Act added the requirements that the holding company itself be well-capitalized and well managed. The Company has not opted to become a financial holding company. The Federal Reserve
Board has the power to order a holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity, or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary, when it has reasonable cause to believe that the continuation of such activity or such
ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary of that holding company. Dividends. The Federal Reserve Board has the power to prohibit dividends by bank holding companies if their actions
constitute unsafe or unsound practices. The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses the Federal Reserve Boards view that a bank holding company should pay
cash dividends only to the extent that the companys net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the companys capital needs, asset quality and
overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve Board also indicated that it would be inappropriate for a bank holding company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. Under the prompt corrective action regulations
adopted by the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Reserve Board may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if the holding companys bank subsidiary is classified as undercapitalized. See Regulation and
Supervision of the Bank  Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. The Federal Reserve Board has long had a policy under which bank holding companies are required to serve as a source of strength for their depository subsidiaries by
providing capital, liquidity and other resources in times of financial distress. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength doctrine and required the issuance of implementing regulations. Stock Repurchases. As a bank holding company, the Company is required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any
purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases 18 Table of Contents or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the Companys consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it
determines that the proposal would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order, directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board. This requirement does not apply to bank holding companies that
are well-capitalized, well-managed and are not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues. Acquisitions. The Company is required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire all, or substantially all,
of the assets of any bank or bank holding company or merge with another bank holding company. Prior Federal Reserve Board approval will also be required for the Company to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of
any bank or bank holding company if, after giving effect to such acquisition, the Company would, directly or indirectly, own or control more than 5% of any class of voting shares of such bank or bank holding company. In evaluating such transactions,
the Federal Reserve Board considers the financial and managerial resources of and future prospects of the companies involved, competitive factors and the convenience and needs of the communities to be served. Bank holding companies may acquire
additional banks in any state, subject to certain restrictions such as deposit concentration limits. With certain exceptions, the Bank Holding Company Act (the BHCA) prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring direct or indirect
ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of a company that is not a bank or a bank holding company, or from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or providing
services for its subsidiaries. The principal exceptions to these prohibitions involve certain non-bank activities, which, by statute or by Federal Reserve Board regulation or order, have been identified as
activities closely related to the business of banking. The activities of the Company are subject to these legal and regulatory limitations under the BHCA and the related Federal Reserve Board regulations. Under the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978 (the CBCA), notice must be submitted to the Federal Reserve Board if any person
(including a company), or any group acting in concert, seeks to acquire 10% of any class of the Companys outstanding voting securities, unless the Federal Reserve Board determines that such acquisition will not result in a change of control of
the bank. Under the CBCA, the Federal Reserve Board has 60 days within which to act on such notice taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the proposed acquirer, the convenience and needs of the
community served by the bank and the antitrust effects of an acquisition. Under the BHCA, any company would be required to obtain prior
approval from the Federal Reserve Board before it may obtain control of the Company within the meaning of the BHCA. Control for BHCA purposes generally is defined to mean the ownership or power to vote 25% or more of any class of the
Companys voting securities or the ability to control in any manner the election of a majority of the Companys directors. Under Indiana banking law, prior approval of the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions is also required before any person may acquire
control of an Indiana bank or bank holding company. The Department will issue a notice approving the transaction if it determines that the persons proposing to acquire the Indiana bank or bank holding company are qualified in character, experience
and financial responsibility, and the transaction does not jeopardize the interests of the public. Capital
Requirements. The Federal Reserve Board maintains guidelines regarding the capital adequacy of bank holding companies, which require bank holding companies to maintain on a consolidated basis, specified minimum ratios of capital to total
assets and capital to risk-weighted assets. These requirements, which generally apply to bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $500 million or more, are substantially similar to, but somewhat more generous than, those applicable to the
Bank. See  Regulation and Supervision of the Bank  Capital Requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to adopt consolidated capital requirements for holding companies that are equally as
stringent as those applicable to the depository institution subsidiaries. That means that certain instruments that had previously been includable in Tier 1 capital for bank holding companies, such as trust preferred securities, will no longer be
eligible for inclusion. The revised capital requirements are subject to certain grandfathering and transition rules. Regulation and
Supervision of the Bank General. The Bank, as an Indiana chartered commercial bank, is subject to extensive regulation,
examination and supervision by the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions and the FDIC. The Bank must file 19 Table of Contents reports with the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions and the FDIC describing its activities and financial condition. The Bank is also subject to certain reserve requirements promulgated
by the Federal Reserve Board. This supervision and regulation is intended primarily for the protection of depositors. The Dodd-Frank Act
provides for the establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve Board. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will assume responsibility for implementing federal consumer financial
protection and fair lending laws and regulations, a function currently handled by federal bank regulatory agencies. However, institutions of $10 billion or less in total assets will continue to be examined for compliance by, and subject to the
enforcement authority of, the federal bank regulator. Federal Banking Law Capital Requirements. The Bank is required to maintain a 4% minimum leverage capital requirement consisting of a ratio of Tier 1 capital
to total assets (3% for institutions receiving the highest rating on the CAMELS rating system). Tier 1 capital is the sum of common stockholders equity, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock (including any related surplus) and minority
interests in consolidated subsidiaries, minus all intangible assets (other than certain mortgage and certain other servicing assets, purchased credit card relationships, credit-enhancing interest-only strips and certain deferred tax assets),
identified losses, investments in certain financial subsidiaries and non-financial equity investments. In addition to the leverage
capital ratio, state chartered nonmember banks must maintain a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8%, of which at least half must be Tier 1 capital. Qualifying total capital consists of Tier 1 capital plus
Tier 2 capital (also referred to as supplementary capital) items. Tier 2 capital items include allowances for loan losses in an amount of up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, cumulative preferred stock and preferred stock with a maturity of over 20
years, certain other capital instruments and up to 45% of pre-tax net unrealized holding gains on equity securities. The includable amount of Tier 2 capital cannot exceed the institutions Tier 1 capital. Qualifying total capital is further
reduced by the amount of the banks investments in banking and finance subsidiaries that are not consolidated for regulatory capital purposes, reciprocal cross-holdings of capital securities issued by other banks, most intangible assets and
certain other deductions. Under the FDIC risk-weighted system, all of a banks balance sheet assets and the credit equivalent amounts of certain off-balance sheet items are assigned to one of four broad risk-weight categories from 0% to 100%,
based on the regulators perception of the risks inherent in the type of assets or item. The aggregate dollar amount of each category is multiplied by the risk weight assigned to that category. The sum of these weighted values equals the
banks risk-weighted assets. At December 31, 2014, the Banks ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total assets was 9.49%,
its ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets was 14.38% and its ratio of total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets was 15.64%. Basel III. On July 9, 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule that revised their risk-based capital
requirements and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel III) and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final
rule applies to all depository institutions, top-tier bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $500 million or more and top-tier savings and loan holding companies. The rule established a new common equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirement (4.5% of risk-weighted assets), increased the minimum Tier 1
capital to risk-based assets requirement (from 4.0% to 6.0% of risk-weighted assets) and assigned a higher risk weight (150%) to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and to certain commercial real estate
facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property. The rule also includes changes in what constitutes
regulatory capital, some of which are subject to a two-year transition period. These changes include the phasing-out of certain instruments as qualifying capital. In addition, Tier 2 capital is no longer limited to the amount of Tier 1 capital
included in total capital. Mortgage servicing rights, certain deferred tax assets and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries over designated percentages of common stock will be required to be deducted from capital, subject to a two-year
transition period. Finally, Tier 1 capital will include accumulated other comprehensive income (which includes all unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities), subject to a two-year transition period. 20 Table of Contents The new capital requirements also include changes in the risk-weights of assets to better reflect
credit risk and other risk exposures. These include a 150% risk weight (up from 100%) for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans and non-residential mortgage loans that are 90 days past due or
otherwise on nonaccrual status; a 20% (up from 0%) credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable; a 250% risk weight (up from 100%) for mortgage
servicing rights and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital; and increased risk-weights (from 0% to up to 600%) for equity exposures. Finally, the rule limits capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a
capital conservation buffer consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The final rule became effective on January 1, 2015. The capital conservation buffer requirement will be phased in beginning
January 1, 2016, at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets, increasing each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. It is managements belief that, as of December 31, 2014, the Company and the Bank have met all capital
adequacy requirements under Basel III on a fully phased-in basis if such requirements were currently effective. Investment
Activities. State-chartered FDIC-insured banks are generally limited in their activities as principal and their equity investments to the type and amount authorized for national banks, notwithstanding state law. Federal law and regulations
permit exceptions to these limitations. The FDIC is authorized to permit institutions to engage in state authorized activities or investments not permissible for national banks (other than non-subsidiary equity investments) if they meet all
applicable capital requirements and it is determined that such activities or investments do not pose a significant risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund. The FDIC has adopted regulations governing the procedures for institutions seeking approval to
engage in such activities or investments. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 specifies that a non-member bank may control a subsidiary that engages in activities as principal that would only be permitted for a national bank to conduct in a
financial subsidiary if a bank meets specified conditions and deducts its investment in the subsidiary for regulatory capital purposes. Interstate Banking and Branching. The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 permitted bank holding
companies to acquire banks in any state subject to specified concentration limits and other conditions. The Interstate Banking Act also authorizes the interstate merger of banks. In addition, among other things, the Interstate Banking Act, as
amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, permits banks to establish de novo branches on an interstate basis provided that state banks chartered by the target state are permitted to establish de novo branches in the state. Dividend Limitations. The Bank may not pay dividends on its capital stock if its regulatory capital would be reduced below the amount
then required for the liquidation account established for the benefit of certain depositors of the Bank at the time of its conversion to stock form. In addition, the Bank may not pay dividends that exceed retained net income for the applicable
calendar year to date, plus retained net income for the preceding two years without prior approval from the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions. Earnings of the Bank appropriated to bad debt reserves and deducted for federal income tax purposes are not available for payment of cash
dividends or other distributions to stockholders without payment of taxes at the then current tax rate by the Bank on the amount of earnings removed from the reserves for such distributions. Under FDIC regulations, the Bank is prohibited from making any capital distributions if, after making the distribution, the Bank would fail to
meet any applicable capital requirements. For additional information about dividend limitations see Note 12 in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Insurance of Deposit Accounts. Under the FDICs risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to one of
four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors, with less risky institutions paying lower assessments. An institutions assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is
assigned. The assessment rate ranges from 2.5 to 45 basis points based on domestic deposits 21 Table of Contents to one based on average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity. No institution may pay a dividend if in default of the federal deposit insurance assessment. The rate schedules
will automatically adjust in the future when the Deposit Insurance Fund reaches certain milestones. No institution may pay a dividend if in default of the federal deposit insurance assessment. The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target Deposit Insurance Fund ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated
insured deposits. The FDIC must seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020. Insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more are supposed to fund the increase. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the 1.5% maximum fund ratio,
instead leaving it to the discretion of the FDIC. The FDIC has the authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in
insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. Prompt
Corrective Regulatory Action. Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulatory authorities take prompt corrective action with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For such
purposes, the law establishes five capital tiers: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. The Federal Reserve Board has adopted regulations to implement prompt corrective action. Among other things, the regulations define the
relevant capital measures for the five capital categories. For the period ended December 31, 2014, an institution is deemed to be well capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based
capital ratio of 6% or greater, and a leverage capital ratio of 5% or greater, and is not subject to a regulatory order, agreement, or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. An institution is deemed to be
adequately capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4% or greater, and generally a leverage capital ratio of 4% or greater. An institution is deemed to be
undercapitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4%, or generally a leverage capital ratio of less than 4%. An institution is deemed to be significantly
undercapitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3%, or a leverage capital ratio of less than 3%. An institution is deemed to be critically undercapitalized
if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2%. As a result of
Basel III (discussed further above), effective January 1, 2015, an institution is deemed to be well capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, a
common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, and a leverage capital ratio of 5% or greater, and is not subject to a regulatory order, agreement, or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.
An institution is deemed to be adequately capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5% or greater and
generally a leverage capital ratio of 4% or greater. An institution is deemed to be undercapitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, a common equity Tier 1
risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.5% or generally a leverage capital ratio of less than 4%. An institution is deemed to be significantly undercapitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, a Tier 1
risk-based capital ratio of less than 4%, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3% or a leverage capital ratio of less than 3%. An institution is deemed to be critically undercapitalized if it has a ratio of
tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2%. Undercapitalized
institutions are subject to growth, capital distribution (including dividend), and other limitations, and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. An institutions compliance with such a plan is required to be guaranteed by any
company that controls the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the banks total assets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the status of adequately capitalized. If an
undercapitalized institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. Significantly undercapitalized institutions are subject to one or more additional restrictions including, but not
limited to, a regulatory order requiring them to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized; requirements to reduce total assets, cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks, or dismiss directors or officers; and
restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers, and capital distributions by the parent holding company. 22 Table of Contents Beginning 60 days after becoming critically undercapitalized, critically
undercapitalized institutions also may not make any payment of principal or interest on certain subordinated debt, extend credit for a highly leveraged transaction, or enter into any material transaction outside the ordinary course of business. In
addition, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver is required for a critically undercapitalized institution within 270 days after it obtains such status. Enforcement. The FDIC has extensive enforcement authority over nonmember insured state banks, including the Bank. This enforcement
authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease and desist orders and remove directors and officers. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and
regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. The FDIC has authority under federal law to appoint a conservator or receiver for an insured bank under certain circumstances, including on the basis of the institutions financial condition or upon
the occurrence of other events, including (1) insolvency; (2) substantial dissipation of assets or earnings through violations of law or unsafe or unsound practices; (3) existence of an unsafe or unsound condition to transact
business; and (4) insufficient capital, or the incurring of losses that will deplete substantially all of the institutions capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment without federal assistance. Reserve Requirements. Under Federal Reserve Board regulations, the Bank is required to maintain non-interest earning reserves against
their transaction accounts (primarily Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (NOW) and regular checking accounts). The regulations generally provide that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows for 2014: a 3% reserve ratio
was assessed on net transaction accounts up to and including $89.0 million; a 10% reserve ratio is applied above $89.0 million. The first $13.3 million of otherwise reservable balances (subject to adjustments by the Federal Reserve Board) are
exempted from the reserve requirements. The amounts are adjusted annually and, for 2015, will require a 3% ratio for up to $103.6 million and an exemption of $14.5 million. At December 31, 2014, the Bank met applicable Federal Reserve Board
reserve requirements. Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of
12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks governed and regulated by the Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB). As a member, the Bank is required to purchase and hold stock in the FHLB of Indianapolis. As of December 31, 2014, the Bank held
stock in the FHLB of Indianapolis in the amount of $3.8 million and was in compliance with the above requirement. Loans to
Executive Officers, Directors and Principal Stockholders. Loans to directors, executive officers and principal stockholders of a state nonmember bank must be made on substantially the same terms as those prevailing for comparable transactions
with persons who are not executive officers, directors, principal stockholders or employees of the Bank unless the loan is made pursuant to a compensation or benefit plan that is widely available to employees and does not favor insiders. Loans to
any executive officer, director and principal stockholder together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated interests generally may not exceed 15% of the Banks unimpaired capital and surplus and all loans to such persons
may not exceed the institutions unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. Loans to directors, executive officers and principal stockholders, and their respective affiliates, in excess of the greater of $25,000 or 5% of capital and surplus (on
any loans where the total outstanding amounts to $500,000 or more) must be approved in advance by a majority of the Board of Directors of the Bank with any interested director not participating in the voting. State nonmember banks are
prohibited from paying the overdrafts of any of their executive officers or directors unless payment is made pursuant to a written, pre-authorized interest-bearing extension of credit plan that specifies a method of repayment or transfer of funds
from another account at the bank. Transactions with Affiliates. A state nonmember bank or its subsidiaries may not engage
in covered transactions with any one affiliate in an amount greater than 10% of such banks capital stock and surplus, and for all such transactions with all affiliates, a state non-member bank is limited to an amount equal to 20%
of capital stock and surplus. All such transactions must also be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the bank or subsidiary as those provided to a nonaffiliate. Certain covered transactions must meet prescribed
collateralization requirements. The term covered transaction includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of a guarantee and similar other types of transactions. An affiliate of a state non-member bank is any company or
entity that controls or is under common control with the state non-member bank and, for purposes of the aggregate limit on transactions with affiliates, any subsidiary that would be deemed a financial subsidiary of a 23 Table of Contents national bank. In a holding company context, the parent holding company of a state non-member bank (such as the Company) and any companies that are controlled by such parent holding company are
affiliates of the state non-member bank. The BHCA further prohibits a depository institution from extending credit to or offering any other services, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition
that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or certain of its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution, subject to certain limited exceptions. Indiana Banking Law Branching. An
Indiana bank is entitled to establish one or more branches de novo or by acquisition in any location or locations in Indiana and in other states (subject to the requirements of federal law for interstate banking). The Bank is
required to file an application with the Department of Financial Institutions. Approval of the application is contingent upon the Departments determination that after the establishment of the branch, the Bank will have adequate capital, sound
management and adequate future earnings. An application to branch must also be approved by the FDIC. Lending Limits. Indiana banks are not subject to percentage of asset or capital limits on their commercial, consumer and non-residential mortgage lending, and accordingly, have more flexibility in structuring their portfolios than federally chartered savings banks.
Indiana law provides that a bank may not make a loan or extend credit to a borrower or group of borrowers in excess of 15% of its unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional 10% of capital and surplus may be lent if secured by specified readily
marketable collateral. Enforcement. The Department has authority to take enforcement action against an Indiana bank in
appropriate cases, including the issuance of cease and desist orders, removal of directors or officers, issuance of civil money penalties and appointment of a conservator or receiver. Other Activities. The Bank is authorized to engage in a variety of agency and fiduciary activities including acting as executors of an
estate, transfer agent and in other fiduciary capacities. On approval from the Department of Financial Institutions, the Bank would be permitted to exercise any right granted to national banks. TAXATION Federal Taxation. The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return on a calendar year end. Banks are
subject to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code) in the same general manner as other corporations. However, institutions, such as the Bank, which met certain definitional tests and other conditions prescribed by
the Code benefited from certain favorable provisions regarding their deductions from taxable income for annual additions to their bad debt reserve. The Companys federal income tax returns have not been audited in the past five years. State Taxation. The State of Indiana imposes a franchise tax which is assessed on qualifying financial institutions, such as the Bank.
The tax is based upon federal taxable income before net operating loss carryforward deductions (adjusted for certain Indiana modifications) and is levied at a rate of 8.5% of apportioned adjusted taxable income. The rate will be reduced to 6.5%,
phased in by 0.5% increments over four years beginning in 2014. The Companys state income tax returns have not been audited
by the State of Indiana since 2008. 24 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT Name Age at December 31, 2014 Principal Position Jerome J.

risks. Before deciding to invest in our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below in conjunction with the other information in this Form 10-K, including the items included as exhibits. Our business, financial condition
and results of operations could be harmed by any of the following risks or by other risks that have not been identified or that we may believe are immaterial or unlikely. The value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of
these risks. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Our increased emphasis on commercial and construction lending may expose us to increased lending risk. At December 31, 2014, our
loan portfolio consisted of $111.5 million, or 34.7%, of commercial real estate loans, $13.6 million, or 4.2%, of construction loans (primarily commercial properties) and $29.4 million, or 9.1%, of commercial and industrial loans and leases. We
intend to continue to maintain our emphasis on the origination of commercial loans. However, these types of loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans because repayment
of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the property, the income stream of the borrowers and, for construction loans, the accuracy of the estimate of the propertys value at completion of construction and the estimated cost of
construction. Commercial and construction loans typically involve larger loan balances compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Commercial and industrial loans expose us to additional risks since they typically are made on the
basis of the borrowers ability to make repayments from the cash flows of the borrowers business and are secured by non-real estate collateral that may depreciate over time. In addition, since such loans generally entail greater risk than
one to four-family residential mortgage loans, we may need to increase our allowance for loan losses to account for the likely increase in probable incurred credit losses associated with the growth of such loans. Also, many of our commercial and
construction borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development
with respect to a one- to four-family residential mortgage loan. Our nonperforming loans have declined, however, we may be
required to increase our provision for loan losses and to charge-off additional loans in the future, each of which could adversely affect our results of operations. Further, our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses
in our loan portfolio. For 2014, we recorded a provision for loan losses of $322,000. We also recorded net loan charge-offs of $412,000. Although we have experienced a slowly improving local economic recovery, other real estate owned has
remained at a relatively high level totaling $6.6 million as of December 31, 2014. Our nonperforming loans totaled $4.4 million, representing 1.37% of total loans, at December 31, 2014. Loans classified as special mention, substandard,
doubtful or loss totaled $11.9 million, representing 3.72% of total loans at December 31, 2014. If these loans do not perform according to their terms and the collateral is insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance, we may be required to
add further reserves to our allowance for loan losses or we may experience loan losses, which could have a material effect on our operating results. Like all financial institutions, we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for loans in
our portfolio that may not be repaid in their entirety. We believe that our allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the corresponding balance sheet date. However, our
allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses, and future provisions for loan losses could materially adversely affect our operating results. In evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses, we consider numerous quantitative factors, including our historical charge-off
experience, growth of our loan portfolio, changes in the composition of our loan portfolio and the volume of delinquent and classified loans. In addition, we use information about specific borrower situations, including their financial position and
estimated collateral values, to estimate the risk and amount of loss for those borrowers. Finally, we also consider many qualitative factors, including general and economic business conditions, current general market collateral valuations, trends
apparent in any of the factors we take into account and other matters, which are by nature more subjective and fluid. Our estimates of the risk of loss and amount of loss on any loan are complicated by the significant uncertainties surrounding our
borrowers abilities to successfully execute their business models through changing economic environments, competitive challenges and other factors. Because of the degree of uncertainty and susceptibility of these factors to change, our actual
losses may vary from our current estimates. 26 Table of Contents At December 31, 2014, our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was
1.22%. Our regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses by recognizing additional provisions for loan losses charged to
expense, or to decrease our allowance for loan losses by recognizing loan charge-offs. Any such additional provisions for loan losses or charge-offs, as required by these regulatory agencies, could have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition and results of operations. A return to recessionary conditions could result in increases in our level of nonperforming loans
and/or reduce demand for our products and services, which would lead to lower revenue, higher loan losses and lower earnings. Following a national home price peak in mid-2006, falling home prices and sharply reduced sales volumes, along with the
collapse of the United States subprime mortgage industry in early 2007, significantly contributed to a recession that officially lasted until June 2009, although the effects continued thereafter. Dramatic declines in real estate values and
high levels of foreclosures resulted in significant asset write-downs by financial institutions, which have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital, to merge with other institutions and, in some cases, to fail. A return of recessionary conditions and/or negative developments in the domestic and international credit markets may significantly affect the
markets in which we do business, the value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. Subsequent declines in real estate values and sales volumes and continued high unemployment levels may result in higher
than expected loan delinquencies, increases in our levels of nonperforming and classified assets and a decline in demand for our products and services. These negative events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our capital,
liquidity, and financial condition. Our cost of operations is high relative to our assets. Our failure to maintain or reduce our
operating expenses costs could hurt our profits. Our operating expenses, which consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits, occupancy, furniture and equipment expense, professional fees, data processing expense, FDIC insurance premiums
and assessments, and marketing, totaled $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, with $614,000 of the $1.1 million increase related to a prepayment penalty paid to
the Federal Home Loan Bank. Newer banking centers in the Indianapolis metropolitan area that have not yet become profitable are currently having a negative impact on our efficiency ratio. The Companys efficiency ratio totaled 82.6% for the
year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 81.1% for the year ended December 31, 2013. Failure to control our expenses could hurt future profits. The building of market share through our branching strategy could cause our expenses to increase faster than revenues. We opened a
full-service banking center in Fishers, Indiana in October 2008, a second banking center in Carmel in December 2008 and a third in Westfield in May 2009. We also purchased property in Plainfield in 2008 with the expectation of building a new
full-service banking center, but those plans were put on hold and the Bank is in the process of determining the appropriate time to begin construction based on its long-term expansion strategy. The Bank purchased two vacant banking centers in June
2013 located in Hamilton County, which is in the Indianapolis metropolitan area, and opened the Noblesville Office in September 2014 and the Fishers Crossing Office in November 2014. A Broad Ripple Banking Center, our first brick and mortar location
in Marion County, is scheduled to open in mid-2015. There are considerable costs involved in opening branches and new branches generally require a period of time to generate sufficient revenues to offset their costs, especially in areas in which we
do not have an established presence. Accordingly, any new branch can be expected to negatively impact our earnings for some period of time until the branch reaches a certain customer base. Changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income and earnings. Our net interest income is the interest we earn on loans
and investment less the interest we pay on our deposits and borrowings. Our interest rate spread is the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and our other sources of funding. Changes in
interest rates could adversely affect our interest rate spread and, as a result, our net interest income and net interest margin. Although the yield we earn on our assets and our funding costs tend to move in the same direction in response to
changes in interest rates, one can rise or fall faster than the other, causing our net interest margin to expand or contract. Our liabilities tend to be shorter in duration than our assets, so they may adjust faster in response to changes in
interest rates. As a result, when interest rates rise, our funding costs may rise faster than the yield we earn on our assets, causing our net interest margin to contract until the yield catches up. Changes in the slope of the yield
curveor the spread between short-term and long-term interest ratescould also reduce our net interest margin. Normally, the yield curve is upward sloping, meaning short-term rates are lower 27 Table of Contents than long-term rates. Because our liabilities tend to be shorter in duration than our assets, when the yield curve flattens or even inverts, we could experience pressure on our net interest
margin as our cost of funds increases relative to the yield we can earn on our assets. Changes in interest rates can also affect: (1) our ability to originate loans; (2) the value of our interest-earning assets; (3) our ability to
obtain and retain deposits in competition with other investment alternatives; and (4) the ability of our borrowers to repay adjustable-rate loans. We operate in a highly regulated environment and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations. The Bank is subject
to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions, its chartering authority, and by the FDIC, as insurer of its deposits. The Company is subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal
Reserve Board. Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage, and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and for the depositors and borrowers of the Bank.
The regulation and supervision by the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions and the FDIC are not intended to protect the interests of investors in the Companys common stock. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their
supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight,
whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations. Regulation of the financial services industry is undergoing major changes, and future legislation could increase our cost of doing business
or harm our competitive position. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) enacted in 2010 has created a significant shift in the way financial institutions operate. The Dodd-Frank Act
created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that
apply to all banks and savings institutions including the authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and
savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks and savings institutions with $10.0 billion or less in assets continue to be examined by their applicable bank regulators. The Dodd-Frank Act contains various other provisions designed
to enhance the regulation of depository institutions and prevent the recurrence of a financial crisis such as occurred in 2008-2009. The full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on our business and operations will not be known for years until regulations
implementing the statute are written and adopted. The Dodd-Frank Act may have a material impact on our operations, particularly through increased regulatory burden and compliance costs. Any future legislative changes could have a material
impact on our profitability, the value of assets held for investment or collateral for loans. Future legislative changes could require changes to business practices or force us to discontinue businesses and potentially expose us to additional costs,
liabilities, enforcement action and reputational risk. We may not be able to realize the full value of our deferred tax asset. We
recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, coupled with unused tax credits and tax benefits from operating loss carryforwards. At
December 31, 2014, our net deferred tax asset was $4.3 million. The net deferred tax asset was composed of approximately $1.2 million of tax benefit from both state and federal net operating loss carryforwards, approximately $954,000 of tax
benefit from temporary differences between book and tax income and an unused federal tax credit of $2.7 million, reduced by a valuation allowance of $608,000. We regularly review our deferred tax asset for recoverability based on our history of earnings, expectations for future earnings and expected
timing of reversals of temporary differences, as well as tax strategies available to expedite the use of both the deferred state tax asset and the deferred federal tax asset. Realization of our deferred tax asset ultimately depends on the existence
of sufficient future taxable income. We currently expect that it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2014 will be fully realizable based on our expected future earnings. Realization of our deferred tax asset
would significantly improve our earnings and capital through a related reversal of the current valuation allowance. Any reduction in the
corporate tax rate for federal or state income taxes could immediately result in partial impairment of the book value of the deferred tax asset, and require a write-down that would be charged against earnings in the year of the enactment of the
related tax law. 28 Table of Contents Strong competition within our market area could hurt our profits and slow growth. We face
intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits. This competition has made it more difficult for us to make new loans and has occasionally forced us to offer higher deposit rates. Price competition for loans and deposits might
result in us earning less on our loans and paying more on our deposits, which reduces net interest income. Competition also makes it more difficult to grow loans and deposits. According to the FDIC, as of June 30, 2014, we held 29.9% of the
deposits in Henry County, Indiana, which was the second largest market share of deposits out of the six financial institutions that held deposits in this county. We also held 9.9% of the deposits in Hancock County, Indiana, which was the fourth
largest market share of deposits out of the seven financial institutions that held deposits in this county. We also maintain offices in four other counties in which we held between 0.8% and 5.6% of the deposits in those counties as of June 30,
2014. Some of the institutions with which we compete have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer services that we do not provide. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative,
regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Technological advances, for example, have lowered barriers to entry, allowed banks to expand their geographic reach by providing
services over the Internet and made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally have been provided by banks. Changes in federal law permit affiliation among banks, securities firms and insurance
companies, which promotes a competitive environment in the financial services industry. Competition for deposits and the origination of loans could limit the Companys growth in the future. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability
to compete successfully in our market area. The trading history of our common stock is characterized by low trading volume. Our common
stock may be subject to sudden decreases. Although our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Capital Market, it has not been regularly traded. We cannot predict whether a more active trading market in our common stock will occur or how liquid that
market might become. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends upon the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time, which presence is
dependent upon the individual decisions of investors, over which we have no control. The market price of our common stock may be highly
volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the factors discussed in other risk factors and the following:  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;  changes in interest rates;  changes in the legal or regulatory environment in which we operate;  press releases, announcements or publicity relating to us or our competitors or relating to trends in our industry;  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts and investors;  future sales of our common stock;  changes in economic conditions in our marketplace, general conditions in the U.S. economy, financial markets or the banking industry; and  other developments affecting our competitors or us. These factors may adversely affect the
trading price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance, and could prevent you from selling your common stock at or above the price you desire. In addition, the stock markets, from time to time, experience extreme price and
volume fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies. These broad fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our trading performance. We may require additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed. We anticipate that we have
adequate capital for the foreseeable future. However, we may at some point 29 Table of Contents need to raise additional capital to support our continued growth or if we incur significant loan or securities impairment. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on
conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you of our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise
additional capital when needed, our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth could be materially impaired. Provisions of our articles of incorporation, bylaws and Indiana law, as well as state and federal banking regulations, could delay or
prevent a takeover of us by a third party. Provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and the corporate law of the State of Indiana could delay, defer or prevent a third party from acquiring us, despite the possible benefit to our
shareholders, or otherwise adversely affect the price of our common stock. These provisions include: supermajority voting requirements for certain business combinations; the election of directors to staggered terms of three years; and advance notice
requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors and for proposing matters that shareholders may act on at shareholder meetings. In addition, we are subject to Indiana laws, including one that prohibits us from engaging in a
business combination with any interested shareholder for a period of five years from the date the person became an interested shareholder unless certain conditions are met. These provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts, discourage bids
for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of, our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for
you and other shareholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our Board of Directors. A failure in or breach of our operational
or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary
information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses. We depend upon our ability to process, record and monitor our client transactions on a continuous basis. As client, public and regulatory expectations regarding operational
and information security have increased, our operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions and breakdowns. Our business, financial, accounting and data processing systems, or
other operating systems and facilities, may stop operating properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. For example, there could be electrical or
telecommunications outages; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes; disease pandemics; events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and, as described below, cyber-attacks.
Although we have business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our business and
clients. Information security risks for financial institutions such as ours have generally increased in recent years in part
because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists and
other external parties. As noted above, our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks. Our business relies on our digital technologies, computer and email
systems, software and networks to conduct its operations. In addition, to access our products and services, our clients may use personal smartphones, tablet PCs, personal computers and other mobile devices that are beyond our control systems.
Although we have information security procedures and controls in place, our technologies, systems, networks and our clients devices may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized
release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our or our clients confidential, proprietary and other information, or otherwise disrupt our or our clients or other third parties business operations. Third parties with whom we do business or that facilitate our business activities, including financial intermediaries or vendors that provide
services or security solutions for our operations, could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints. 30 Table of Contents Although to date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other
information security breaches, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature of these threats. As a result, cyber security and
the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a focus for us. As threats continue to
evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate information security vulnerabilities. Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our business and clients, or cyber-attacks or
security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our clients use to access our products and services could result in client attrition, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation
costs and/or additional compliance costs, any of which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Capital rules require insured depository institutions and their holding companies to hold more capital. The impact of the capital rules on
our financial condition and operations is uncertain but could be materially adverse. In July 2013, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule for the Basel III capital framework. These rules substantially amend the regulatory risk-based capital
rules applicable to us. The rules phase in over time beginning in 2015 and will become fully effective in 2019. The rules apply to the Company as well as to the Bank. Beginning in 2015, our minimum capital requirements will be (i) a common Tier
1 equity ratio of 4.5%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital (common Tier 1 capital plus Additional Tier 1 capital) of 6% (up from 4%) and (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (the current requirement). Our leverage ratio requirement will remain at the 4%
level now required. Beginning in 2016, a capital conservation buffer will phase in over three years, ultimately resulting in a requirement of 2.5% on top of the common Tier 1, Tier 1 and total capital requirements, resulting in a require common Tier
1 equity ratio of 7%, a Tier 1 ratio of 8.5%, and a total capital ratio of 10.5%. Failure to satisfy any of these three capital requirements will result in limits on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses.
These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. We are
subject to a variety of operational risks, environmental, legal and compliance risks, and the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations . We are
exposed to many types of operational risks, including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, and unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors, including clerical or
record-keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems. Negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate
governance and acquisitions and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and keep customers and can expose us to
litigation and regulatory action. Actual or alleged conduct by the Bank can also result in negative public opinion about our other businesses. If personal, non-public, confidential or proprietary information of customers in our possession were to be misappropriated, mishandled or
misused, we could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include, for example, erroneously providing such information to parties who are not permitted to have the
information, either by fault of our systems, employees, or counterparties, or the interception or inappropriate acquisition of such information by third parties. Because the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded
before they are discovered and successfully rectified. Our necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process transactions and our large transaction volume may further increase the risk that technical flaws or employee tampering or
manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect. We also may be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control (for example, computer viruses or
electrical or telecommunications outages, or natural disasters, disease pandemics or other damage to property or physical assets) which may give rise to disruption of service to customers and to financial loss or liability. We are further exposed to
the risk that our external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations (or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as we are) and to the risk that our (or our vendors)
business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate. The occurrence of any of these risks could result in our 31 Table of Contents diminished ability to operate our business (for example, by requiring us to expend significant resources to correct the defect), as well as potential liability to clients, reputational damage and
regulatory intervention, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, perhaps materially. We face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and
regulations. The federal Bank Secrecy Act, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the PATRIOT Act) and other laws and regulations require
financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain effective anti-money laundering programs and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network,
established by the U.S. Treasury Department to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the
individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. Federal and state bank regulators also have begun to focus on compliance with Bank Secrecy Act and
anti-money laundering regulations. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures and systems of the financial institutions that we may acquire in the future are deficient, we would be subject to liability,
including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans, which would
negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us. The geographic concentration of our markets in Indiana makes our business highly susceptible to downturns in these local economies and
depressed banking markets, which could materially and adversely affect us. Unlike larger financial institutions that are more geographically diversified, we are a regional banking franchise concentrated in certain markets in Indiana. Our success
depends significantly on growth in population, income levels, deposits and housing starts in the geographic markets in which we operate. The local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on our commercial, real estate and
construction loans, the ability of borrowers to repay these loans, and the value of the collateral securing these loans. Adverse changes in, and deterioration of, the economic conditions in the markets in which we operate in Indiana could negatively
affect our financial condition, results of operations and profitability. A deterioration in economic conditions could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business:  loan delinquencies may increase;  problem assets and foreclosures may increase;  demand for our products and services may decline; and  collateral for loans that we make may decline in value, in turn reducing a customers borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with the our loans.
