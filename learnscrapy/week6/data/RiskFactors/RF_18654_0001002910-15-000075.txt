PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS GENERAL Ameren, headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, is a public utility holding company under PUHCA 2005, administered by the FERC. Ameren was formed in 1997 by the merger of Ameren Missouri and CIPSCO Inc., which was the parent company of CIPS. Ameren acquired CILCORP Inc., which was the parent company of CILCO, in 2003 and IP in 2004. CIPS, CILCO, and IP were merged to form Ameren Illinois in 2010. Ameren’s primary assets are its equity interests in its subsidiaries, including Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois. Ameren’s subsidiaries are separate, independent legal entities with separate businesses, assets, and liabilities. Dividends on Ameren’s common stock and the payment of other expenses by Ameren depend on distributions made to it by its subsidiaries. Below is a summary description of Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois. A more detailed description can be found in Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies under Part II, Item 8, of this report. • Ameren Missouri operates a rate-regulated electric generation, transmission, and distribution business and a rate-regulated natural gas transmission and distribution business in Missouri. • Ameren Illinois operates rate-regulated electric and natural gas transmission and distribution businesses in Illinois. Ameren has various other subsidiaries responsible for activities such as the provision of shared services. Ameren also has a subsidiary, ATXI, that operates a FERC rate-regulated electric transmission business. ATXI is developing MISO-approved electric transmission projects, including the Illinois Rivers, Spoon River, and Mark Twain projects. Ameren is also pursuing reliability projects within Ameren Missouri's and Ameren Illinois' service territories as well as competitive electric transmission investment opportunities outside of these territories, including investments outside of MISO. In December 2013, Ameren completed the divestiture of New AER to IPH. In January 2014, Medina Valley completed its sale of the Elgin, Gibson City, and Grand Tower gas-fired energy centers to Rockland Capital. In addition, in 2013, Ameren abandoned the Meredosia and Hutsonville energy centers upon the completion of the divestiture of New AER to IPH. Ameren has begun to demolish the Hutsonville energy center and expects to demolish the Meredosia energy center thereafter. As a result of these events, Ameren segregated the operating results, assets, and liabilities for New AER and for the Elgin, Gibson City, Grand Tower, Meredosia, and Hutsonville energy centers and presented them separately as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this report. Unless otherwise stated, the following information presented in Part I, Item 1, of this report excludes discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Note 16 – Divestiture Transactions and Discontinued Operations under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information. The following table presents our total employees at December 31, 2014 : Ameren Missouri 3,924 Ameren Illinois 3,208 Ameren Services and Other 1,395 Ameren 8,527 As of January 1, 2015, the IBEW, the IUOE, the LIUNA, and the UA labor unions collectively represented about 55% of Ameren’s total employees. They represented 63% of the employees at Ameren Missouri and 60% at Ameren Illinois. The collective bargaining agreements have terms ranging from two to six years, and expire between 2015 and 2017. For additional information about the development of our businesses, our business operations, and factors affecting our operations and financial position, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7, of this report and Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies under Part II, Item 8, of this report. 5 Table of Contents BUSINESS SEGMENTS Ameren has two reportable segments: Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois. Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois each have one reportable segment. The Ameren Missouri segment for both Ameren and Ameren Missouri includes all the operations of Ameren Missouri. The Ameren Illinois segment for both Ameren and Ameren Illinois consists of all of the operations of Ameren Illinois. See Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 17 – Segment Information under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information on reporting segments. RATES AND REGULATION Rates The rates that Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI are allowed to charge for their utility services significantly influence the results of operations, financial position, and liquidity of these companies and Ameren. The electric and natural gas utility industry is highly regulated. The utility rates charged to customers are determined, in large part, by governmental entities, including the MoPSC, the ICC, and the FERC. Decisions by these entities are influenced by many factors, including the cost of providing service, the prudency of expenditures, the quality of service, regulatory staff knowledge and experience, customer intervention, economic conditions, public policy, and social and political views. Decisions made by these governmental entities regarding rates are largely outside of our control. These decisions, as well as the regulatory lag involved in filing and getting new rates approved, could have a material effect on the results of operations, financial position, and liquidity of Ameren, Ameren Missouri, and Ameren Illinois. The extent of the regulatory lag varies for each of Ameren's electric and natural gas jurisdictions, with the FERC-regulated electric and Illinois electric distribution jurisdictions experiencing the least amount of regulatory lag. Depending on the jurisdiction, the effects of regulatory lag are mitigated through a variety of means, including the use of a future test year, the implementation of trackers and riders, the deferral of depreciation for assets not yet included in rate base, the level and timing of expenditures, and by regulatory frameworks that include annual revenue requirement reconciliations. The MoPSC regulates rates and other matters for Ameren Missouri. The ICC regulates rates and other matters for Ameren Illinois, as well as non-rate utility matters for ATXI. ATXI does not have retail distribution customers; therefore, the ICC does not have authority to regulate its rates. The FERC regulates Ameren Missouri's, Ameren Illinois', and ATXI's cost-based rates for the wholesale distribution and transmission of energy in interstate commerce and various other matters discussed below under General Regulatory Matters. The following table summarizes, by rate jurisdiction, the key terms of the rate orders in effect for customer billings for each of Ameren's rate-regulated utilities as of January 1, 2015. Regulator Allowed Return on Equity Percent of Common Equity Rate Base (in billions) Portion of Ameren's 2014 Operating Revenues (a) Ameren Missouri Electric service (b)(c) MoPSC 9.8% 52.3% $6.8 56% Natural gas delivery service (d) MoPSC (d) 52.9% $0.2 3% Ameren Illinois Electric distribution delivery service (e) ICC 9.25% 51.0% $2.1 23% Natural gas delivery service (f) ICC 9.1% 51.7% $1.1 16% Electric transmission delivery service (g) FERC 12.38% 53.8% $0.9 2% ATXI Electric transmission delivery service (g) FERC 12.38% 56.0% $0.5 (h) (a) Includes pass-through costs recovered from customers, such as purchased power for electric distribution delivery service and gas purchased for resale for natural gas delivery service, and intercompany eliminations. (b) Ameren Missouri's electric generation, transmission, and delivery service rates are bundled together and charged to retail customers under a combined electric service rate. (c) Based on the MoPSC's December 2012 rate order, which became effective on January 2, 2013. Ameren Missouri will have new electric service rates effective by June 2015, upon the completion of its rate case proceeding that was filed in July 2014. (d) Based on the MoPSC's January 2011 rate order, which became effective on February 20, 2011. This rate order did not specify the allowed return on equity. (e) Based on the ICC's December 2014 rate order, which became effective on January 1, 2015. The December 2014 rate order was based on 2013 recoverable costs, expected net plant additions for 2014, and the monthly yields during 2013 of the 30-year United States Treasury bonds plus 580 basis points. Ameren Illinois' 2015 electric distribution delivery service revenues will be based on its 2015 actual recoverable costs, rate base, and return on common equity, as calculated under the IEIMA's performance-based formula ratemaking framework. (f) Based on the ICC's December 2013 rate order, which became effective on January 1, 2014. The rate order was based on a 2014 future test year. (g) Transmission rates are updated and become effective each January. They are determined by a company-specific, forward-looking rate formula based on each year's forecasted information. The 12.38% return is the subject of two FERC complaint proceedings that challenge the allowed return on common equity for MISO transmission owners. (h) Less than 1%. 6 Table of Contents Ameren Missouri Electric Ameren Missouri’s electric operating revenues are subject to regulation by the MoPSC. If certain criteria are met, then Ameren Missouri’s electric rates may be adjusted without a traditional rate proceeding. The FAC permits Ameren Missouri to recover, through customer rates, 95% of changes in net energy costs greater than or less than the amount set in base rates without a traditional rate proceeding, subject to prudence reviews. Net energy costs, as defined in the FAC, include fuel and purchased power costs, including transportation charges and revenues, net of off-system sales. Similarly, all of Ameren Missouri's MEEIA costs, including customer energy efficiency program costs, lost revenues, and any incentive awards, are recovered through a rider that may be adjusted without a traditional rate proceeding. In addition to the FAC and the MEEIA recovery mechanisms, Ameren Missouri employs other cost recovery mechanisms, including a vegetation management and infrastructure inspection cost tracker, a pension and postretirement benefit cost tracker, an uncertain tax position tracker, a renewable energy standards cost tracker, a solar rebate program tracker, and a storm cost tracker. Each of these trackers allows Ameren Missouri to record the difference between the level of incurred costs under GAAP and the level of such costs built into rates as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability, which will be included in rates in a future MoPSC rate order. The FERC regulates the rates charged and the terms and conditions for electric transmission services. Because Ameren Missouri is a member of MISO, its transmission rate is calculated in accordance with the MISO OATT. The transmission rate is updated each June based on Ameren Missouri’s filings with the FERC. This rate is not directly charged to Missouri retail customers because, in Missouri, the MoPSC includes transmission-related costs and revenues in bundled retail rates. As discussed above, Ameren Missouri transportation charges and revenues are included in the FAC. Natural Gas Ameren Missouri’s natural gas operating revenues are subject to regulation by the MoPSC. If certain criteria are met, then Ameren Missouri’s natural gas rates may be adjusted without a traditional rate proceeding. PGA clauses permit prudently incurred natural gas costs to be passed directly to customers. The ISRS also permits certain prudently incurred natural gas infrastructure replacement costs to be recovered from customers on a more timely basis between rate cases. The return on equity to be used by Ameren Missouri for purposes of the ISRS tariff is 10%. Ameren Illinois Electric Ameren Illinois' electric distribution delivery service operating revenues are regulated by the ICC, while its electric transmission delivery service operating revenues are regulated by the FERC. In 2014, Ameren Illinois' electric distribution delivery service accounted for 91% of its total electric operating revenues. The remainder were related to electric transmission delivery service. Under Illinois law, electric customers may choose their own electric energy provider. However, Ameren Illinois is required to serve as the provider of last resort for electric customers within its territory who have not chosen an alternative retail electric supplier. In 2014, Ameren Illinois was the provider of last resort for approximately 26% of electric customers within its territory. Ameren Illinois’ obligation to provide this required electric service varies by customer size. Ameren Illinois is not required to offer fixed-priced electric service to customers with electric demands of 400 kilowatts or greater, as the market for service to this group of customers has been declared competitive. Power and related procurement costs incurred by Ameren Illinois are passed directly to its customers through a cost recovery mechanism. Ameren Illinois participates in the performance-based formula ratemaking process established pursuant to the IEIMA. The IEIMA was designed to provide for the recovery of actual costs of electric delivery service that are prudently incurred and to reflect the utility's actual regulated capital structure through a formula for calculating the return on equity component of the cost of capital. The return on equity component of the formula rate is equal to the average for the calendar year of the monthly yields of the 30-year United States Treasury bonds plus 580 basis points. Ameren Illinois' actual return on equity relating to electric delivery service is subject to a collar adjustment on earnings in excess of 50 basis points greater or less than its allowed return. The IEIMA provides for an annual reconciliation of the revenue requirement necessary to reflect the actual costs incurred in a given year with the revenue requirement included in customer rates for that year, including an allowed return on equity. This annual revenue reconciliation, along with the collar adjustment, if necessary, will be collected from or refunded to customers within the next two years. Ameren Illinois is also subject to performance standards under the IEIMA. Failure to achieve the standards would result in a reduction in the company's allowed return on equity calculated under the formula. The performance standards include improvements in service reliability to reduce both the frequency and duration of outages, reduction in the number of estimated bills, reduction of consumption on inactive meters, and a reduction in uncollectible accounts expense. The IEIMA provides for return on equity penalties totaling up to 30 basis points in 2015, 34 basis points in 2016 through 2018, and 38 basis points in 2019 through 2022 if the performance standards are not met. The formula ratemaking process is currently effective until the end of 2017. Legislation passed by the Illinois General Assembly, 7 Table of Contents which is awaiting the governor's approval, would extend the formula rate process until the end of 2019, with further extension possible through 2022. Between 2012 and 2021, Ameren Illinois is required, pursuant to the IEIMA, to invest $625 million in capital projects incremental to its average electric delivery service capital projects investments of $228 million for calendar years 2008 through 2010, to modernize its distribution system. Through 2014, Ameren Illinois has invested $149 million in IEIMA capital projects toward its $625 million requirement. Such investments are expected to encourage economic development and to create an estimated 450 additional jobs within Illinois. Ameren Illinois is subject to monetary penalties if 450 additional jobs are not created during the peak program year. Ameren Illinois employs cost recovery mechanisms for power procurement, customer energy efficiency programs, certain environmental costs, and bad debt expense not recovered in base rates. Ameren Illinois also has a tariff rider to recover the costs of certain asbestos-related claims. Because Ameren Illinois is a member of MISO, its transmission rate is calculated in accordance with the MISO OATT. Currently, the FERC-allowed return on common equity in the ratemaking formula for MISO transmission owners is 12.38%. However, the 12.38% return is the subject of two FERC complaint proceedings that challenge the allowed return on common equity for MISO transmission owners. In January 2015, the FERC scheduled the initial case for hearing proceedings, requiring an initial decision to be issued no later than November 30, 2015. Also in January 2015, FERC approved an incentive adder of up to 50 basis points on the allowed base return on common equity for Ameren Illinois' participation in an RTO. Ameren Illinois will defer collection of this incentive adder until the issuance of the final order addressing the initial MISO complaint case. Ameren Illinois has received FERC approval to use a company-specific, forward-looking rate formula framework in setting its transmission rates. These forward-looking rates are updated each January with forecasted information. A reconciliation during the year, which adjusts for the actual revenue requirement and actual sales volumes, is used to adjust billing rates in a subsequent year. In Illinois, the AMIL pricing zone transmission rate is charged directly to wholesale customers and alternative retail electric suppliers, which serve unbundled retail load. The AMIL pricing zone transmission rate and other MISO-related costs are collected from retail customers who have not chosen an alternative retail electric supplier through a rider mechanism in Ameren Illinois' retail distribution tariffs. Natural Gas Ameren Illinois’ natural gas operating revenues are subject to regulation by the ICC. If certain criteria are met, then Ameren Illinois’ natural gas rates may be adjusted without a traditional rate proceeding. PGA clauses permit prudently incurred natural gas costs to be passed directly to customers. Also, Ameren Illinois employs cost recovery mechanisms for customer energy efficiency programs, certain environmental costs, and bad debt expenses not recovered in base rates. In July 2013, Illinois enacted the CSRA, which encourages Illinois natural gas utilities to accelerate modernization of the state's natural gas infrastructure. The law allows natural gas utilities to file for a QIP rider. A QIP rider provides for a surcharge to be added to customers' bills to recover depreciation expense for and to earn a return on qualifying natural gas investments that were not previously included in base rates. Recovery begins two months after the natural gas investments are placed in service and will continue until the investments are included in the base rates of a future natural gas rate case. Ameren Illinois received ICC approval for its QIP rider in January 2015, and subsequently began including qualified investments and recording revenue under this regulatory framework. In January 2015, Ameren Illinois filed a request with the ICC seeking approval to increase its annual revenues for natural gas delivery service. In an attempt to reduce regulatory lag, Ameren Illinois' request employed a 2016 future test year and also included a proposal to implement a decoupling rider mechanism for residential and small nonresidential customers. This decoupling rider is designed to ensure that changes in natural gas sales volumes do not affect Ameren Illinois' annual revenues for these rate classes. A decision by the ICC in this proceeding is required by December 2015. ATXI Like Ameren Illinois, ATXI is a member of MISO, and its transmission rate is calculated in accordance with the MISO OATT. Currently, the FERC-allowed return on common equity in the ratemaking formula for MISO transmission owners is 12.38%. However, as discussed above, the 12.38% return is the subject of two FERC complaint proceedings that challenge the allowed return on common equity for MISO transmission owners. In January 2015, the FERC scheduled the initial case for hearing proceedings, requiring an initial decision to be issued no later than November 30, 2015. Also in January 2015, FERC approved an incentive adder of up to 50 basis points on the allowed base return on common equity for ATXI's participation in an RTO. ATXI will defer collection of this incentive adder until the issuance of the final order addressing the initial MISO complaint case. ATXI has received FERC approval to use a company-specific, forward-looking rate formula framework in setting its transmission rates. These forward-looking rates are updated each January with forecasted information. A reconciliation during the year, which adjusts for the actual revenue requirement and actual sales volumes, is used to adjust billing rates in a subsequent year. Additionally, the FERC has approved transmission rate incentives relating to the three MISO-approved multi-value projects discussed below, which allow construction work in progress to be included in rate base, thereby improving the timeliness of cash recovery. The three MISO-approved multi-value projects being developed by ATXI are the Illinois Rivers, Spoon River, and Mark Twain projects. The first project, Illinois Rivers, involves the construction of a 345-kilovolt line from western Indiana across the 8 Table of Contents state of Illinois to eastern Missouri. ATXI has obtained a certificate of public convenience and necessity and project approval from the ICC for the entire Illinois Rivers project. A full range of construction activities for the Illinois Rivers project began in 2014. The first sections of the Illinois Rivers project are expected to be completed in 2016. The last section of this project is expected to be completed in 2019. The Spoon River project is in northwest Illinois and the Mark Twain project is in northeast Missouri. In August 2014, ATXI filed a request for a certificate of public convenience and necessity and project approval from the ICC for the Spoon River project. A decision is expected from the ICC in 2015. ATXI expects to file a request for a certificate of public convenience and necessity and project approval from the MoPSC for the Mark Twain project in 2015. These two projects are expected to be completed in 2018. The total investment by ATXI in these three projects is expected to be more than $1.6 billion. For additional information on Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI rate matters, including the FERC complaint cases challenging the allowed return on common equity for MISO transmission owners, see Results of Operations and Outlook in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk under Part II, Item 7A, and Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters and Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report. General Regulatory Matters Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI must receive FERC approval to enter into various transactions, such as issuing short-term debt securities and conducting certain acquisitions, mergers, and consolidations involving electric utility holding companies. In addition, Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI must receive authorization from the applicable state public utility regulatory agency to issue stock and long-term debt securities (with maturities of more than 12 months) and to conduct mergers, affiliate transactions, and various other activities. Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI are also subject to mandatory reliability standards, including cybersecurity standards adopted by the FERC, to ensure the reliability of the bulk power electric system. These standards are developed and enforced by NERC pursuant to authority given to it by the FERC. If Ameren or its subsidiaries were determined not to be in compliance with any of these mandatory reliability standards, they could incur substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions. Under PUHCA 2005, the FERC and any state public utility regulatory agency may access books and records of Ameren and its subsidiaries that are determined to be relevant to costs incurred by Ameren’s rate-regulated subsidiaries that may affect jurisdictional rates. PUHCA 2005 also permits the MoPSC and the ICC to request that the FERC review cost allocations by Ameren Services to other Ameren companies. Operation of Ameren Missouri’s Callaway energy center is subject to regulation by the NRC. Its facility operating license expires in October 2024. In December 2011, Ameren Missouri submitted an application to the NRC to extend the energy center's operating license to 2044. There is no date by which the NRC must act on this relicensing request. Ameren Missouri’s Osage hydroelectric energy center and Taum Sauk pumped-storage hydroelectric energy center, as licensed projects under the Federal Power Act, are subject to FERC regulations affecting, among other aspects, the general operation and maintenance of the projects. The license for the Osage hydroelectric energy center expires in March 2047. The license for the Taum Sauk pumped-storage hydroelectric energy center expires in June 2044. Ameren Missouri’s Keokuk energy center and its dam in the Mississippi River between Hamilton, Illinois, and Keokuk, Iowa, are operated under authority granted by an Act of Congress in 1905. For additional information on regulatory matters, see Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters, Note 10 – Callaway Energy Center, and Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report. Environmental Matters Certain of our operations are subject to federal, state, and local environmental statutes and regulations relating to the safety and health of personnel, the public, and the environment. These environmental statutes and regulations include requirements relating to identification, generation, storage, handling, transportation, disposal, recordkeeping, labeling, reporting, and emergency response in connection with hazardous and toxic materials; safety and health standards; and environmental protection requirements, including standards and limitations relating to the discharge of air and water pollutants and the management of waste and byproduct materials. Failure to comply with these statutes or regulations could have material adverse effects on us. We could be subject to criminal or civil penalties by regulatory agencies or we could be ordered by the courts to pay private parties. Except as indicated in this report, we believe that we are in material compliance with existing statutes and regulations that currently apply to our operations. The EPA is developing and implementing environmental regulations that will have a significant impact on the electric utility industry. Over time, compliance with these regulations could be costly for certain companies, including Ameren Missouri, that operate coal-fired power plants. Significant new rules proposed or promulgated include the regulation of CO 2 emissions from existing power plants through the proposed Clean Power Plan and from new power plants through the revised NSPS; revised national ambient air quality standards for ozone, fine particulates, SO 2, and NO x emissions; the CSAPR, which requires further reductions of SO 2 emissions and NO x emissions from power plants; a regulation governing management of CCR and CCR impoundments; the MATS, which require reduction of emissions of mercury, toxic metals, and acid gases from power plants; revised NSPS for particulate matter, SO 2 , and NO x emissions from new sources; new effluent standards applicable to waste 9 Table of Contents water discharges from power plants and new regulations under the Clean Water Act that could require significant capital expenditures, such as modifications to water intake structures or new cooling towers at Ameren Missouri’s energy centers. Certain of these new and proposed regulations, if adopted, are likely to be challenged through litigation, so their ultimate implementation, as well as the timing of any such implementation, is uncertain. Although many details of the future regulations are unknown, the combined effects of the new and proposed environmental regulations could result in significant capital expenditures and increased operating costs for Ameren and Ameren Missouri. Compliance with these environmental laws and regulations could be prohibitively expensive, result in the closure or alteration of the operation of some of Ameren Missouri’s energy centers, or require capital investment. Ameren and Ameren Missouri expect these costs would be recoverable through rates, subject to MoPSC prudence review, but the nature and timing of costs, as well as the applicable regulatory framework, could result in regulatory lag. These new and proposed environmental regulations could also impact the cost of, and demand for, power and natural gas, which is acquired for Ameren Missouri's natural gas customers and Ameren Illinois' electric and natural gas customers. For additional discussion of environmental matters, including NO x , SO 2 , and mercury emission reduction requirements, proposed reductions to CO 2 emissions, remediation efforts, CCR management regulations, and a discussion of the EPA’s allegations of violations of the Clean Air Act and Missouri law in connection with projects at Ameren Missouri's Rush Island energy center, see Liquidity and Capital Resources in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7, and Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report. TRANSMISSION AND SUPPLY OF ELECTRIC POWER Ameren owns an integrated transmission system that is comprised of the transmission assets of Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI. Ameren also operates two balancing authority areas: AMMO and AMIL. During 2014, the peak demand was 8,199 megawatts in AMMO and 8,913 megawatts in AMIL. The Ameren transmission system directly connects with 15 other balancing authority areas for the exchange of electric energy. Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI are transmission-owning members of MISO. Ameren Missouri is authorized by the MoPSC to participate in MISO through May 2018. Ameren Missouri is required to file a study with the MoPSC in November 2017, as it has done periodically since it began participating in MISO in 2003, that evaluates the costs and benefits of Ameren Missouri's continued participation in MISO beyond May 2018. The Ameren Companies are members of the SERC. The SERC is responsible for the bulk electric power system in all or portions of Missouri, Illinois, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Virginia, Florida, Oklahoma, Iowa, and Texas. Owners and operators, including the Ameren Companies, of the bulk electric power system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the NERC and its regional entities, such as the SERC, which are all enforced by the FERC. Ameren Missouri Ameren Missouri’s electric supply is primarily generated from its energy centers. Factors that could cause Ameren Missouri to purchase power include, among other things, absence of sufficient owned generation, energy center outages, the fulfillment of renewable energy portfolio requirements, the failure of suppliers to meet their power supply obligations, extreme weather conditions, and the availability of power at a cost lower than its generation cost. Ameren Missouri continues to evaluate its longer-term needs for new baseload capacity, including nuclear and peaking electric generation capacity. The potential need for new energy center construction is dependent on several key factors, including continuation of, and customer participation in, energy efficiency programs beyond 2015, load growth, and the potential for more stringent environmental regulation of coal-fired power plants, which could lead to the retirement of current baseload assets or alterations in the manner in which those assets operate. Because of the significant time required to plan, acquire permits for, and build a baseload energy center, Ameren Missouri continues to study alternatives and is taking steps to preserve options to meet future demand. Steps include evaluating the potential for further customer energy efficiency programs and evaluating potential sites for natural-gas-fired generation. Additional steps include maintaining options for future nuclear generation and obtaining an operating license extension for the existing Callaway energy center from 2024 until 2044. Ameren Missouri is also exploring options to expand renewable generation and further diversify its generation portfolio. Ameren Missouri filed its integrated resource plan with the MoPSC in October 2014. The integrated resource plan is a 20-year plan that supports a more fuel-diverse energy portfolio in Missouri, including coal, solar, wind, natural gas and nuclear power. The plan includes expanding renewable generation, retiring coal-fired generation as energy centers reach the end of their useful lives, and adding natural-gas-fired combined cycle generation. Ameren Missouri continues to study alternatives, including additional customer energy efficiency programs, that could help defer new energy center construction. See also Outlook in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7, Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters, Note 10 – Callaway Energy Center, and Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report. Ameren Illinois Any electric supply purchased by Ameren Illinois for its retail customers comes either through procurement processes conducted by the IPA or through markets operated by MISO. The 10 Table of Contents IPA administers an RFP process through which Ameren Illinois procures its expected supply obligation. The power and related procurement costs incurred by Ameren Illinois are passed directly to its customers through a cost recovery mechanism. Under Illinois law, transmission and distribution service rates are regulated, while electric customers are allowed to purchase power from an alternative retail electric supplier. In 2014, approximately 741,000 retail customers representing 74% of Ameren Illinois' annual retail kilowatthour sales had elected to purchase their electricity from alternative retail electric suppliers. Ameren Illinois continues to collect delivery charges for distribution and transmission services from customers who purchase electricity from alternative retail electric suppliers. See Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters, Note 14 – Related Party Transactions and Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information on power procurement in Illinois. POWER GENERATION The following table presents the source of Ameren's and Ameren Missouri's electric generation, excluding purchased power, for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013, and 2012: Coal Nuclear Natural Gas/Oil Renewables (a) 2014 76% 21% (b) 3% 2013 77 19 (b) 3 2012 73 24 1 2 (a) Renewable power generation includes production from Ameren Missouri's hydroelectric, methane gas, and solar energy centers but excludes purchased renewable energy credits. (b) Less than 1% of total fuel supply. The following table presents the cost of fuels for electric generation for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013, and 2012: Cost of Fuels (dollars per mmbtu) 2014 2013 2012 Coal (a) $ 2.151 $ 2.050 $ 1.925 Nuclear 0.918 0.942 0.964 Natural gas (b) 11.226 7.907 4.517 Weighted average – all fuels (c) $ 1.936 $ 1.874 $ 1.743 (a) Represents the cost of coal and the costs for transportation, which include hedges for railroad diesel fuel surcharges. (b) Represents the cost of natural gas and fixed and variable costs for transportation, storage, balancing, and fuel losses for delivery to the energy center. (c) Represents all costs, including transportation, for fuels used in our energy centers, including coal, nuclear, natural gas, methane gas, oil, and propane. Methane gas, oil, and propane are not individually listed in this table because their use is minimal. Coal Ameren Missouri has an ongoing need for coal for generation, so it pursues a price-hedging strategy consistent with this requirement. Ameren Missouri has agreements in place to purchase coal and to transport it to energy centers. Coal supply agreements for Ameren Missouri expire at the end of 2017. Coal transport agreements for Ameren Missouri expire at the end of 2019. Ameren Missouri has coal transport agreements with Union Pacific Railroad and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway. As of December 31, 2014 , Ameren Missouri had price-hedged 100% of its expected coal supply and coal transportation requirements for generation in 2015. Ameren Missouri burned 20 million tons of coal in 2014. About 98% of Ameren Missouri’s coal is purchased from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming. The remaining coal is typically purchased from the Illinois Basin. Inventory may be adjusted because of generation levels or uncertainties of supply due to potential work stoppages, delays in coal deliveries, equipment breakdowns, and other factors. Deliveries from the Powder River Basin have occasionally been restricted because of rail congestion and maintenance, derailments, and weather. As of December 31, 2014 , coal inventories for Ameren Missouri were below targeted levels due to delivery delays. Disruptions in coal deliveries could cause Ameren Missouri to pursue a strategy that could include reducing sales of power during low-margin periods, buying higher-cost fuels to generate required electricity, and purchasing power from other sources. Nuclear The production of nuclear fuel involves the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates, the conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride gas, the enrichment of that gas, the conversion of the enriched uranium hexafluoride gas into uranium dioxide fuel pellets and the fabrication into usable fuel assemblies. Ameren Missouri has entered into uranium, uranium conversion, uranium enrichment, and fabrication contracts to procure the fuel supply for its Callaway nuclear energy center. The Callaway energy center requires refueling at 18-month intervals. The last refueling was completed in November 2014. The next refueling is scheduled for spring 2016. There is no refueling scheduled for 2015 and 2018. Ameren Missouri currently has agreements or inventories to price-hedge approximately 97%, 71%, and 60% of Callaway's 2016, 2017, and 2019 refueling requirements, respectively. Ameren Missouri has uranium (concentrate and hexafluoride) inventories and 11 Table of Contents supply contracts sufficient to meet all of its uranium and conversion requirements through at least 2017. Ameren Missouri has enriched uranium inventories and enrichment supply contracts sufficient to satisfy enrichment requirements through at least 2019 and f uel fabrication service contracts through at least 2019. Ameren Missouri expects to enter into additional contracts to purchase nuclear fuel. The nuclear fuel markets are competitive, and prices can be volatile; however, Ameren Missouri does not anticipate any significant problems in meeting its future supply requirements. Natural Gas Supply for Generation To maintain deliveries to natural-gas-fired energy centers throughout the year, especially during the summer peak demand, Ameren Missouri’s portfolio of natural gas supply resources includes firm transportation capacity and firm no-notice storage capacity leased from interstate pipelines. Ameren Missouri primarily uses the interstate pipeline systems of Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, Trunkline Gas Company, Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America, and Mississippi River Transmission Corporation to transport natural gas to energy centers. In addition to physical transactions, Ameren Missouri uses financial instruments, including some in the NYMEX futures market and some in the OTC financial markets, to hedge the price paid for natural gas. Ameren Missouri’s natural gas procurement strategy is designed to ensure reliable and immediate delivery of natural gas to its energy centers. This strategy is accomplished by optimizing transportation and storage options and by minimizing cost and price risk through various supply and price-hedging agreements that allow access to multiple gas pools, supply basins, and storage services. As of December 31, 2014 , Ameren Missouri had price-hedged about 3% of its expected natural gas supply requirements for generation in 2015. Renewable Energy Illinois and Missouri have enacted laws requiring electric utilities to include renewable energy resources in their portfolios. Illinois required renewable energy resources to equal or exceed 2% of the total electricity that Ameren Illinois supplied to its eligible retail customers as of June 1, 2008, with that percentage increasing to 10% by June 1, 2015, and to 25% by June 1, 2025. For the 2014 plan year, Ameren Illinois met its requirement that 9% of its total electricity for eligible retail customers be procured from renewable energy resources. Based on current forecasts, Ameren Illinois has committed to procure sufficient renewable energy credits under the IPA-administered procurement process to meet the renewable energy portfolio requirement through at least May 2017. Ameren Illinois has entered into agreements through 2032 with renewable energy suppliers to obtain renewable energy credits. Approximately 65% of the 2015 plan year renewable energy requirement is expected to be met through these agreements. The remaining requirement will be met through IPA procurements, which resulted in contracts that have terms through December 2017. In Missouri, utilities are required to purchase or generate electricity equal to at least 2% of native load sales from renewable sources, with that percentage increasing to at least 15% by 2021, subject to a 1% annual limit on customer rate impacts. At least 2% of each renewable energy portfolio requirement must be derived from solar energy. In 2014, Ameren Missouri met its requirement to purchase or generate at least 5% of its native load sales from renewable energy resources. Ameren Missouri expects to satisfy the nonsolar requirement into 2018 with its Keokuk energy center, its Maryland Heights energy center, and with a 102-megawatt power purchase agreement through June 2024 with a wind farm operator in Iowa. The Maryland Heights energy center generates electricity by burning methane gas collected from a landfill. Ameren Missouri is meeting the solar energy requirement through the purchase of solar-generated renewable energy credits from customer-installed systems and generation from its O'Fallon energy center. Under the same Missouri statute that requires utilities to purchase or generate electricity from renewable sources, Ameren Missouri is required to have a rebate program to provide an incentive for customers to install solar generation on their premises. In accordance with the statute and a 2013 MoPSC order, Ameren Missouri is required to provide $92 million of solar rebates by 2020, which was substantially completed by December 31, 2014. Also included in its 2013 order, the MoPSC authorized Ameren Missouri to employ a tracker to allow Ameren Missouri to record the costs it incurred under its solar rebate program as a regulatory asset. Ameren Missouri expects to recover the costs of these rebates, along with the estimated $9 million carrying cost of the regulatory asset, over a three-year period beginning with the effective date of rates in its July 2014 electric rate case. Energy Efficiency Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois have implemented energy efficiency programs to educate and help their customers become more efficient users of energy. In Missouri, the MEEIA established a regulatory framework that, among other things, allows electric utilities to recover costs related to MoPSC-approved customer energy efficiency programs. The law requires the MoPSC to ensure that a utility’s financial incentives are aligned to help customers use energy more efficiently, to provide timely cost recovery, and to provide earnings opportunities associated with cost-effective energy efficiency programs. Missouri does not have a law mandating energy efficiency standards. The MoPSC's December 2012 electric rate order approved Ameren Missouri's implementation of the MEEIA megawatthour savings targets, customer energy efficiency programs, and associated cost recovery mechanisms and incentive awards. Ameren Missouri invested $76 million in these programs through 2014 and expects to invest an additional $71 million in 2015. A MEEIA rider allows Ameren Missouri to collect from or refund to customers any annual difference in the actual amounts incurred and the amounts collected from customers for the MEEIA program costs and its lost revenues. 12 Table of Contents Additionally, the MEEIA provides for incentive awards that would allow Ameren Missouri to earn additional revenues by achieving certain energy efficiency goals. Under its current energy efficiency plan, which is effective for 2013 through 2015, Ameren Missouri can earn approximately $19 million if 100% of its energy efficiency goals are achieved during that time period, with the potential to earn more if energy savings exceed those goals. Ameren Missouri must achieve at least 70% of its energy efficiency goals before it can earn any incentive award. The recovery of the incentive award from customers, if the energy efficiency goals are achieved, is expected in 2017 through the above-mentioned rider. In December 2014, Ameren Missouri filed an energy efficiency plan with the MoPSC under the MEEIA. This filing proposed a three-year plan that includes a portfolio of customer energy efficiency programs along with a cost recovery mechanism. If the plan is approved, beginning in January 2016, Ameren Missouri intends to invest $135 million over three years in the proposed customer energy efficiency programs. Ameren Missouri requested continued use of a MEEIA rider that allows it to collect from or refund to customers any difference in the actual amounts incurred and the amounts collected from customers for the MEEIA program costs and its lost revenues. In addition, Ameren Missouri requested incentives to earn additional revenues by achieving certain energy efficiency goals, including approximately $25 million if 100% of its energy efficiency goals are achieved during the three-year period. See Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information. Illinois has enacted a law requiring Ameren Illinois to offer customer energy efficiency programs. The law also allows recovery mechanisms of the programs’ costs. The ICC has issued orders approving Ameren Illinois’ electric and natural gas energy efficiency plans as well as cost recovery mechanisms by which program costs can be recovered from customers. Additionally, as part of its IEIMA upgrades, Ameren Illinois expects to invest $360 million in smart grid infrastructure, including smart meters that enable customers to improve energy efficiency. Ameren Illinois began the installation of smart meters in 2014. NATURAL GAS SUPPLY FOR DISTRIBUTION Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois are responsible for the purchase and delivery of natural gas to their utility customers. Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois each develop and manage a portfolio of natural gas supply resources. These resources include firm gas supply under term agreements with producers, interstate and intrastate firm transportation capacity, firm storage capacity leased from interstate pipelines, and on-system storage facilities to maintain natural gas deliveries to customers throughout the year and especially during peak demand periods. Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois primarily use Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, Trunkline Gas Company, Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America, Mississippi River Transmission Corporation, Northern Border Pipeline Company, and Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation interstate pipeline systems to transport natural gas to their systems. In addition to transactions requiring physical delivery, financial instruments, including those entered into in the NYMEX futures market and in the OTC financial markets, are used to hedge the price paid for natural gas. Natural gas purchase costs are passed on to customers of Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois under PGA clauses, subject to prudence reviews by the MoPSC and the ICC. As of December 31, 2014 , Ameren Missouri had price-hedged 80% and Ameren Illinois had price-hedged 78% of their expected 2015 natural gas supply requirements. For additional information on our fuel and purchased power supply, see Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources and Effects of Inflation and Changing Prices in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7, of this report.

INDUSTRY ISSUES We are facing issues common to the electric and natural gas utility industry. These issues include: • political, regulatory, and customer resistance to higher rates; • the potential for changes in laws, regulations, and policies at the state and federal levels; • tax law changes that accelerate depreciation deductions, which reduce current tax payments but also result in rate base reductions and limit the ability to claim other deductions and use carryforward tax benefits; • cybersecurity risks, including loss of operational control of energy centers and electric and natural gas transmission and distribution systems and/or loss of data, such as utility customer data and account information; • the potential for more intense competition in generation, supply, and distribution, including new technologies; • pressure on customer growth and usage in light of economic conditions and energy efficiency initiatives; • changes in the structure of the industry as a result of changes in federal and state laws, including the formation and growth of independent transmission entities; • pressure to reduce the allowed return on common equity on FERC-regulated electric transmission assets; • the availability of fuel and fluctuations in fuel prices; • the availability of qualified labor and material, and rising costs; • the availability of a skilled workforce, including retaining the specialized skills of those who are nearing retirement; • regulatory lag; • the influence of macroeconomic factors, such as yields on United States Treasury securities and allowed rates of return on equity provided by regulators; • higher levels of infrastructure investments could result in negative or decreased free cash flows, defined as cash flows from operating activities less cash flows from investing 13 Table of Contents activities and dividends paid; • public concern about the siting of new facilities; • complex new and proposed environmental laws, regulations and requirements, including air and water quality standards, mercury emissions standards, CCR management requirements, and greenhouse gas limitations; • public concern about the potential impacts to the environment from the combustion of fossil fuels; • aging infrastructure and the need to construct new power generation, transmission and distribution facilities, which have long time frames for completion, with little long-term ability to predict power and commodity prices and regulatory requirements; • legislation or proposals for programs to encourage or mandate energy efficiency and renewable sources of power, such as solar, and the macroeconomic debate over who should pay for those programs; • public concern about nuclear generation and decommissioning and the disposal of nuclear waste; and • consolidation of electric and natural gas utility companies. We are monitoring these issues. Except as otherwise noted in this report, we are unable to predict what impact, if any, these issues will have on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.

RISK FACTORS Investors should review carefully the following material risk factors and the other information contained in this report. The risks that the Ameren Companies face are not limited to those in this section. There may be further risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be material that may adversely affect the results of operations, financial position, and liquidity of the Ameren Companies. REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE RISKS We are subject to extensive regulation of our businesses, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. We are subject to extensive federal, state, and local regulation. This extensive regulatory framework, some but not all of which is more specifically identified in the following risk factors, regulates, among other matters, the electric and natural gas utility industries; rate and cost structure of utilities; operation of nuclear energy centers; construction and operation of generation, transmission, and distribution facilities; acquisition, disposal, depreciation and amortization of assets and facilities; transmission reliability; and present or prospective wholesale and retail competition. In the planning and management of our operations, we must address the effects of existing and proposed laws and regulations and potential changes in the regulatory framework, including initiatives by federal and state legislatures, RTOs, utility regulators, and taxing authorities. Significant changes in the nature of the regulation of our businesses could require changes to our business planning and management of our businesses and could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. Failure to obtain adequate rates or regulatory approvals in a timely manner; failure to obtain necessary licenses or permits from regulatory authorities; the impact of new or modified laws, regulations, standards, interpretations, or other legal requirements; or increased compliance costs could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. The electric and natural gas rates that we are allowed to charge are determined through regulatory proceedings, which are subject to intervention and appeal and also to legislative actions, which are largely outside of our control. Any events that prevent us from recovering our costs or from earning adequate returns on our investments could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. The rates that we are allowed to charge for our utility services significantly influence our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. The electric and natural gas utility industries are extensively regulated. The utility rates charged to our customers are determined by governmental entities, including the MoPSC, the ICC, and the FERC. Many factors influence decisions by these entities, including the cost of providing service, the prudency of expenditures, the quality of service, regulatory staff knowledge and experience, customer intervention, economic conditions, public policy, as well as social and political views. Decisions made by these governmental entities regarding rates are largely outside of our control. We are exposed to regulatory lag to varying degrees by jurisdiction, which, if unmitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. Rate orders are also subject to appeal, which creates additional uncertainty as to the rates we will ultimately be allowed to charge for our services. From time to time, our regulators will approve trackers, riders, or other mechanisms that allow electric or natural gas rates to be adjusted without a traditional rate proceeding. These mechanisms are not permanent and could be changed or terminated. Ameren Missouri's electric and natural gas utility rates and Ameren Illinois' natural gas utility rates are typically established in regulatory proceedings that take up to 11 months to complete. Rates established in those proceedings for Ameren Missouri are primarily based on historical costs and revenues. Natural gas rates established in those proceedings for Ameren Illinois may be based on historical or estimated future costs and revenues. Thus, the rates that a utility is allowed to charge may not match its costs at any given time. Rates include an allowed rate of return on investments determined by the regulator. Although rate regulation is premised on providing an opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, there can be no assurance that the regulator will 17 Table of Contents determine that our costs were prudently incurred or that the regulatory process will result in rates that will produce full recovery of such costs or provide for an adequate return on those investments. In years when capital investments and operations costs rise or customer usage declines, we may not be able to earn the allowed return established by the regulator. This could result in the deferral or elimination of planned capital investments, which could reduce the rate base investments on which we earn a rate of return. Additionally, increasing rates could result in regulatory and legislative actions, as well as competitive and political pressures, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. As a result of its participation in the performance-based formula ratemaking process established pursuant to the IEIMA, Ameren Illinois’ return on equity for its electric distribution business is directly correlated to yields on United States Treasury bonds. Additionally, Ameren Illinois is required to achieve performance objectives, capital spending levels, and job creation targets. Failure to meet these requirements could adversely affect Ameren's and Ameren Illinois' results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. Ameren Illinois is participating in the performance-based formula ratemaking process established pursuant to the IEIMA for its electric distribution business. The ICC annually reviews Ameren Illinois’ performance-based rate filings under the IEIMA for reasonableness and prudency. If the ICC were to conclude that Ameren Illinois’ incurred costs were not prudently incurred, the ICC would disallow recovery of such costs. The return on equity component of the formula rate is equal to the average for the calendar year of the monthly yields of 30-year United States Treasury bonds plus 580 basis points. Therefore, Ameren Illinois’ annual return on equity under the formula ratemaking process for its electric distribution business is directly correlated to yields on such bonds, which are outside of Ameren Illinois’ control. A 50 basis point change in the average monthly yields of the 30-year United States Treasury bonds would result in an estimated $6 million change in Ameren's and Ameren Illinois' 2015 net income. Ameren Illinois is also subject to performance standards. Failure to achieve the standards would result in a reduction in the company’s allowed return on equity calculated under the formula. The IEIMA provides for return on equity penalties totaling 30 basis points in 2015, 34 basis points in each year from 2016 through 2018, and 38 basis points in each year from 2019 through 2022 if the performance standards are not met. Between 2012 and 2021, Ameren Illinois is required to invest $625 million in capital projects incremental to its average electric delivery capital projects investments of $228 million for calendar years 2008 through 2010, in order to modernize its distribution system. Ameren Illinois is subject to monetary penalties if 450 additional jobs are not created in Illinois during the peak program year. Unless it is extended, the IEIMA formula ratemaking process will expire in 2017. When the performance-based formula rate process expires, Ameren Illinois would be required to establish future rates through a traditional rate proceeding with the ICC, which might not result in rates that produce a full or timely recovery of costs or provide for an adequate return on investments. We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations. Significant capital expenditures are required to achieve and maintain compliance with these laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in closure of facilities, alterations to the manner in which these facilities operate, increased operating costs, adverse impacts to our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity, or exposure to fines and liabilities. We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations enforced by federal, state, and local authorities. From the beginning phases of siting and development to the operation of existing or new electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities and natural gas storage, transmission and distribution facilities, our activities involve compliance with diverse environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations address emissions; discharges to water, water usage, impacts to air, land, and water, and chemical and waste handling. Complex and lengthy processes are required to obtain and renew approvals, permits, or licenses for new, existing, or modified facilities. Additionally, the use and handling of various chemicals or hazardous materials require release prevention plans and emergency response procedures. We are also subject to liability under environmental laws that address the remediation of environmental contamination of property currently or formerly owned by us or by our predecessors, as well as property contaminated by hazardous substances that we generated. Such properties include MGP sites and third-party sites, such as landfills. Additionally, private individuals may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against us. They could allege injury from exposure to hazardous materials, could seek to compel remediation of environmental contamination, or could recover damages resulting from that contamination. The EPA is developing and implementing environmental regulations that will have a significant impact on the electric utility industry. Over time, compliance with these regulations could be costly for certain companies, including Ameren Missouri, that operate coal-fired power plants. Certain of these new and proposed regulations, if adopted, are likely to be challenged through litigation, so their ultimate implementation, as well as the timing of any such implementation, is uncertain. Ameren is also subject to risks in connection with changing or conflicting interpretations of existing laws and regulations. The EPA is engaged in an enforcement initiative to determine whether coal-fired power plants failed to comply with the requirements of the NSR and NSPS provisions under the Clean Air Act when the 18 Table of Contents power plants implemented modifications. In January 2011, the Department of Justice, on behalf of the EPA, filed a complaint against Ameren Missouri in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. An outcome in this matter adverse to Ameren Missouri could require substantial capital expenditures and the payment of substantial penalties, neither of which can be determined at this time. Such expenditures could affect unit retirement and replacement decisions. In January 2014, the EPA published proposed regulations that would set revised CO 2 emissions standards for new power plants. The proposed standards would establish separate emissions limits for new natural-gas-fired plants and new coal-fired plants. In June 2014, the EPA proposed the Clean Power Plan, which sets forth CO 2 emissions standards that would be applicable to existing power plants. The proposed Clean Power Plan would require each state to develop plans to achieve CO 2 emission standards that the EPA calculated for each state. The EPA believes that the Clean Power Plan would achieve a 30% reduction in the nation's existing power plant CO 2 emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. The proposed rule also has interim goals of aggressively reducing CO 2 emissions by 2020. The EPA expects the proposed rule will be finalized in 2015. Ameren Missouri’s integrated resource plan is projected to achieve the carbon emissions reductions proposed in the EPA’s Clean Power Plan by 2035, rather than the EPA’s final target date of 2030 or its interim target dates beginning in 2020. Ameren Missouri continues to evaluate its potential compliance plans for the proposed Clean Power Plan. Preliminary studies suggest that if the proposed Clean Power Plan were to be finalized in its current form, Ameren Missouri may need to incur new or accelerated capital expenditures and increased fuel costs in order to achieve compliance. As proposed, the Clean Power Plan would require states, including Missouri and Illinois, to submit compliance plans as early as 2016. The states’ compliance plans might require Ameren Missouri to construct natural-gas-fired combined cycle generation and renewable generation, at a currently estimated cost of approximately $2 billion by 2020, that Ameren Missouri believes would otherwise not be necessary to meet the energy needs of its customers. Additionally, Missouri’s implementation of the proposed rules, if adopted, could result in the closure or alteration of the operation of some of Ameren Missouri’s coal and natural gas-fired energy centers, which could result in increased operating costs or impairment of assets. The Clean Power Plan may negatively impact electric system reliability for Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois. Ameren and Ameren Missouri have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to environmental compliance and site remediation. New or revised environmental regulations, enforcement initiatives, or legislation could result in a significant increase in capital expenditures and operating costs, decreased revenues, increased financing requirements, penalties or fines, or reduced operations of some of Ameren Missouri's coal-fired energy centers, which, in turn, could lead to increased liquidity needs and higher financing costs. Actions required to ensure that our facilities and operations are in compliance with environmental laws and regulations could be prohibitively expensive if the costs are not recovered through rates. Environmental laws could require Ameren Missouri to close or to alter significantly the operation of its energy centers. Moreover, if Ameren Missouri requests recovery of these capital expenditures and costs through rates, the MoPSC could deny recovery of all or a portion of these costs, prevent timely recovery, or make changes to the regulatory framework in an effort to minimize rate volatility and customer rate increases. Capital expenditures and costs to comply with future legislation or regulations that are not recoverable through rates might result in Ameren Missouri closing coal-fired energy centers earlier than planned, which would lead to an impairment of assets and reduced revenues. We are unable to predict the ultimate impact of these matters on our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. Government challenges to our tax positions, as well as tax law changes and the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions, could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity. We are required to make judgments in order to estimate tax obligations. These judgments include reserves for potential adverse outcomes for tax positions that may be challenged by tax authorities. The obligations, which include income taxes and taxes other than income taxes, involve complex matters that ultimately could be litigated. We also estimate our ability to use tax benefits, including those in the form of carryforwards and tax credits that are recorded as deferred tax assets on our balance sheets. A disallowance of these tax benefits could have a material adverse impact on our results of operation, financial position, and liquidity. Customers’, legislators’ and regulators’ opinions of us are affected by many factors, including system reliability, implementation of our investment plans, protection of customer information, rates, and media coverage. To the extent that customers, legislators or regulators develop a negative opinion of us, our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity could be negatively affected. Service interruptions due to failures of equipment or facilities as a result of severe or destructive weather or other causes, and the ability of Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois to promptly respond to such failures, can affect customer satisfaction. In addition to system reliability issues, the success of modernization efforts, such as those planned for Ameren Illinois’ electric and natural gas delivery systems, our ability to safeguard sensitive customer information, and other actions can affect customer satisfaction. The timing and magnitude of rate increases and volatility of rates can also affect customer satisfaction. Customers', legislators' and regulators' opinions of us can also be affected by media coverage, including the proliferation of social media, which may include information, whether factual or not, that damages our brand and reputation. If customers, legislators or regulators have a negative opinion of us and our utility services, this could result in increased regulatory oversight and could impact the returns on common equity we are allowed to earn. Additionally, negative opinions about us could make it more difficult for our utilities to achieve 19 Table of Contents favorable legislative or regulatory outcomes. Negative opinions could also result in sales volume reductions and increased use of distributed generation. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. We are subject to federal regulatory compliance and proceedings, which increase our risk of regulatory penalties and other sanctions. The FERC can impose civil penalties of $1 million per violation per day for violation of FERC statutes, rules, and orders, including mandatory NERC reliability standards. As owners and operators of bulk power transmission systems and electric energy centers, we are subject to mandatory NERC reliability standards, including cybersecurity standards. Compliance with these mandatory reliability standards may subject us to higher operating costs and may result in increased capital expenditures. If we were found not to be in compliance with these mandatory reliability standards or the FERC statutes, rules, and orders, we could incur substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. The FERC also conducts audits and reviews of Ameren Missouri's, Ameren Illinois', and ATXI's accounting records to assess the accuracy of its formula ratemaking process and has the ability to require retroactive refunds to customers for previously billed amounts, with interest. OPERATIONAL RISKS The construction of and capital improvements to our electric and natural gas utility infrastructure involve substantial risks. These risks include escalating costs, unsatisfactory performance by the projects when completed, the inability to complete projects as scheduled, cost disallowances by regulators, and the inability to earn an adequate return on invested capital, any of which could result in higher costs and the closure of facilities. We expect to incur significant capital expenditures in order to make investments to improve our electric and natural gas utility infrastructure and to comply with existing environmental regulations. We estimate that we will incur up to $9.3 billion (Ameren Missouri - up to $3.9 billion ; Ameren Illinois - up to $4.0 billion ; ATXI - up to $1.4 billion) of capital expenditures during the period from 2015 through 2019 . These estimates include allowance for equity funds used during construction. Investments in Ameren’s rate-regulated operations are expected to be recoverable from ratepayers, but are subject to prudence reviews and, depending on the jurisdiction, regulatory lag. Our ability to complete construction projects successfully within projected estimates is contingent upon many variables and subject to substantial risks. These variables include, but are not limited to, project management expertise and escalating costs for materials, labor, and environmental compliance. Delays in obtaining permits, shortages in materials and qualified labor, suppliers and contractors who do not perform as required under their contracts, changes in the scope and timing of projects, the inability to raise capital on reasonable terms, or other events beyond our control that could occur may materially affect the schedule, cost, and performance of these projects. With respect to capital expenditures for pollution control equipment, there is a risk that a power plant may not be permitted to continue to operate if pollution control equipment is not installed by prescribed deadlines or does not perform as expected. Should any such pollution control equipment not be installed on time or perform as expected, Ameren Missouri could be subject to additional costs and to the loss of its investment in the project or facility. All of these risks could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. As of December 31, 2014, Ameren Missouri had capitalized $69 million of costs incurred to license additional nuclear generation at its existing Callaway energy center site. If efforts are abandoned or if management concludes that it is probable the costs incurred will be disallowed in rates, a charge to earnings would be recognized in the period in which that determination was made. The NRC review of the COL application to license additional nuclear generation at the Callaway energy center site is currently suspended through the end of 2015. Ameren and Ameren Illinois may not be able to execute their electric transmission investment plans or to realize the expected return on those investments. Ameren, through ATXI and Ameren Illinois, is allocating significant additional capital resources to electric transmission investments. This allocation of capital resources is based on the FERC's regulatory framework and a rate of return on common equity that is currently higher than that allowed by our state commissions. However, the FERC regulatory framework and rate of return is subject to change, including changes as a result of third-party complaints and challenges at the FERC. The regulatory framework may not be as favorable, or the rate of return may be lower, in the future. Currently, the FERC-allowed return on common equity for MISO transmission owners is 12.38%. In November 2013, a complaint case was filed with the FERC seeking a reduction in the allowed return on common equity under the MISO tariff. A second complaint case was filed in February 2015. These complaint cases could negatively affect Ameren Illinois' and ATXI's allowed return. Any such reduction would also result in a refund of transmission service revenues earned since the filing of the initial complaint case in November 2013. A 50 basis point reduction in the FERC-allowed return on common equity would reduce Ameren's and Ameren Illinois' 2015 earnings by an estimated $4 million and $2 million, respectively, based on projected rate base. A significant portion of Ameren's planned electric transmission investments consists of three separate projects to be constructed by ATXI, which have been approved by MISO as multi-value projects. The total investment by ATXI in these three projects is expected to be more than $1.6 billion. The last of these projects is expected to be completed in 2019. A failure by ATXI to complete these three projects on time and within projected cost estimates could adversely affect Ameren's results 20 Table of Contents of operations, financial position, and liquidity. The FERC has issued multiple orders, which are subject to ongoing litigation, eliminating the right of first refusal for an electric utility to construct within its service territory certain new transmission projects for which there will be regional cost sharing. If these orders are upheld by the courts, Ameren might need to compete to build certain future electric transmission projects in its subsidiaries' service territories. Such competition could prevent Ameren from investing in future electric transmission projects to the extent desired. Also, Ameren may not be successful in its efforts to build transmission assets outside of its subsidiaries' service territories or MISO. Our electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities are subject to operational risks that could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. Our financial performance depends on the successful operation of electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. Operation of electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities involves many risks, including: • facility shutdowns due to operator error or a failure of equipment or processes; • longer-than-anticipated maintenance outages; • aging infrastructure that may require significant expenditures to operate and maintain; • disruptions in the delivery of fuel or lack of adequate inventories, including ultra-low-sulfur coal used for Ameren Missouri’s compliance with environmental regulations; • lack of adequate water required for cooling plant operations; • labor disputes; • inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements, including those relating to environmental laws; • disruptions in the delivery of electricity that impact our customers; • handling, storage, and disposition of CCR; • unusual or adverse weather conditions or other natural disasters, including severe storms, droughts, floods, tornadoes, earthquakes, solar flares, and electromagnetic pulses; • accidents that might result in injury or loss of life, extensive property damage, or environmental damage; • cybersecurity risks, including loss of operational control of Ameren Missouri's energy centers and our transmission and distribution systems and loss of data, such as utility customer data and account information through insider or outsider actions; • failure of other operators' facilities and the effect of that failure on our electric system and customers; • the occurrence of catastrophic events such as fires, explosions, acts of sabotage or terrorism, pandemic health events, or other similar occurrences; • limitations on amounts of insurance available to cover losses that might arise in connection with operating our electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities; and • other unanticipated operations and maintenance expenses and liabilities. Ameren Missouri’s ownership and operation of a nuclear energy center creates business, financial, and waste disposal risks. Ameren Missouri’s ownership of the Callaway energy center subjects it to the risks of nuclear generation, which include the following: • potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling, and disposal of radioactive materials; • continued uncertainty in the federal government plan to permanently store spent nuclear fuel and the risk of being required to provide for long-term storage of spent nuclear fuel at the Callaway energy center; • limitations on the amounts and types of insurance available to cover losses that might arise in connection with the Callaway energy center or other United States nuclear facilities; • uncertainties with respect to contingencies and retrospective premium assessments relating to claims at the Callaway energy center or any other United States nuclear facilities; • public and governmental concerns about the adequacy of security at nuclear facilities; • uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear facilities at the end of their licensed lives; • limited availability of fuel supply; • costly and extended outages for scheduled or unscheduled maintenance and refueling; and • potential adverse effects of a natural disaster or acts of sabotage or terrorism. The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety requirements for nuclear facilities. In the event of noncompliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines or to shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. Revised safety requirements promulgated from time to time by the NRC could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear facilities such as Ameren Missouri’s Callaway energy center. In addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could have a material but indeterminable adverse effect on Ameren's and Ameren Missouri’s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or relicensing of any domestic nuclear unit and could also cause the NRC to impose additional conditions or requirements on the industry, which could increase costs and result in additional capital expenditures. Under revised standards relating to seismic risk, the NRC may require Ameren Missouri to further evaluate the impact of an earthquake on its Callaway energy center due its proximity to a fault line, which could require the installation of additional capital equipment. Our natural gas distribution and storage activities 21 Table of Contents involve numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs that could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. Inherent in our natural gas distribution and storage activities are a variety of hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, accidental explosions, mechanical problems and cybersecurity risks, which could cause substantial financial losses. In addition, these hazards could result in serious injury, loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental impacts, and impairment of our operations, which in turn could lead us to incur substantial losses. In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. The location of distribution lines and storage facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, business centers, industrial sites, and other public gathering places, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. A major domestic incident involving natural gas systems could lead to additional capital expenditures and increased regulation of natural gas utilities. The occurrence of any of these events could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. Significant portions of our electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities and natural gas transmission and distribution facilities are aging. This aging infrastructure may require additional maintenance expenditures or may require replacement. Our aging infrastructure may pose risks to system reliability and expose us to expedited or additional unplanned capital expenditures and operating costs. All of Ameren Missouri’s coal-fired energy centers were constructed prior to 1978, while its Callaway nuclear energy center was constructed prior to 1984. The age of these energy centers increases the risks of unplanned outages, reduced generation output, and higher maintenance expense. If, at the end of its life, an energy center's cost has not been fully recovered, Ameren Missouri may be negatively affected if such cost is not allowed in rates by the MoPSC. Aging transmission and distribution facilities are more prone to failure than new facilities, which results in higher maintenance expense and the need to replace these facilities with new infrastructure. Even if the system is properly maintained, its reliability may ultimately deteriorate and negatively affect our ability to serve our customers, which could result in additional oversight by our regulators. The higher maintenance costs and capital expenditures for new replacement infrastructure could cause additional rate volatility for our customers, resistance by our regulators to allow customer rate increases, and/or regulatory lag in some of our jurisdictions, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. Energy conservation, energy efficiency, distributed generation, and other factors that reduce energy demand could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. Requirements and incentives to reduce energy consumption have been proposed by regulatory agencies and introduced by legislatures. Conservation and energy efficiency programs are designed to reduce energy demand. Unless there is a regulatory mechanism ensuring recovery, a decline in usage will result in an under-recovery of fixed costs at our rate-regulated businesses. Ameren Missouri, even with the implementation of customer energy efficiency programs under the MEEIA, is exposed to declining usage losses from energy efficiency efforts not related to its specific programs as well as from distributed generation sources such as solar panels. Additionally, macroeconomic factors resulting in low economic growth or contraction within our service territories could reduce energy demand. Technological advances could reduce customer electricity consumption. Ameren Missouri generates power at utility-scale energy centers to achieve economies of scale and to produce power at a competitive cost. Some distributed generation technologies have recently become more cost-competitive. It is possible that advances in technology and legislative or regulatory actions will continue to reduce the costs of these alternative methods of producing power to a level that is competitive with that of Ameren Missouri's energy centers. Increased adoption of these technologies could decrease our revenues as customers might not use our generation, transmission, and distribution services at current levels. Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois might incur stranded costs, which ultimately might not be recovered through rates. Failure to retain and attract key officers and other skilled professional and technical employees could adversely affect our operations. Our businesses depend upon our ability to employ and retain key officers and other skilled professional and technical employees. A significant portion of our work force is nearing retirement, including many employees with specialized skills, such as maintaining and servicing our electric and natural gas infrastructure and operating our energy centers. Our operations are subject to acts of sabotage, war, terrorism, cyber attacks, and other intentionally disruptive acts. Like other electric and natural gas utilities, our energy centers, fuel storage facilities, transmission and distribution facilities, and information systems may be targets of terrorist activities, including cyber attacks, which could disrupt our ability to produce or distribute some portion of our energy products. Any such disruption could result in a significant decrease in revenues or significant additional costs for repair, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. Our industry has begun to see an increase in volume and sophistication of cybersecurity incidents from international activist organizations, countries, and individuals. A security breach of our physical assets or information systems could affect the reliability of the transmission and distribution system, disrupt electric generation, and/or subject us to financial harm associated with theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information, including sensitive customer and employee data. If a significant breach occurred, our reputation could be adversely affected, 22 Table of Contents customer confidence could be diminished, or we could be subject to legal claims, any of which could result in a significant decrease in revenues or significant additional costs for remedying the impacts of such a breach. Our generation, transmission and distribution systems are part of an interconnected system. Therefore, a disruption caused by a cybersecurity incident at another utility, electric generator, RTO, or commodity supplier could also adversely affect our businesses. We maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. In addition, regulations could require changes in our security measures and could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. Ameren Missouri may ultimately not collect its receivable from an insurance company that provided liability coverage at the time of the breach of the upper reservoir of its Taum Sauk pumped-storage hydroelectric energy center, which could have a material adverse effect on Ameren’s and Ameren Missouri’s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. In December 2005, there was a breach of the upper reservoir at Ameren Missouri’s Taum Sauk pumped-storage hydroelectric energy center. This breach resulted in significant flooding in the local area, which damaged a state park. Ameren Missouri had liability insurance coverage for the Taum Sauk incident, subject to certain limits and deductibles. Ameren’s and Ameren Missouri’s results of operations, financial position, and liquidity could be adversely affected if Ameren Missouri’s remaining liability insurance claim of $41 million as of December 31, 2014, is not paid. The insurance claim is currently subject to litigation. FINANCIAL, ECONOMIC AND MARKET RISKS Our businesses are dependent on our ability to access the capital markets successfully. We may not have access to sufficient capital in the amounts and at the times needed. We rely on short-term and long-term debt as significant sources of liquidity and funding for capital requirements not satisfied by our operating cash flow, as well as to refinance long-term debt. The inability to raise debt or equity capital on reasonable terms, or at all, could negatively affect our ability to maintain and to expand our businesses. Events beyond our control, such as a recession or extreme volatility in the debt, equity, or credit markets, may create uncertainty that could increase our cost of capital or impair or eliminate our ability to access the debt, equity, or credit markets, including our ability to draw on bank credit facilities. Any adverse change in our credit ratings could reduce access to capital and trigger additional collateral postings and prepayments. Such changes could also increase the cost of borrowing and fuel, power and natural gas supply, among other things, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. Certain Ameren subsidiaries, such as ATXI, rely on Ameren for access to capital. Circumstances that limit Ameren’s access to capital could impair its ability to provide those subsidiaries with needed capital. Ameren’s holding company structure could limit its ability to pay common stock dividends and to service its debt obligations. Ameren is a holding company; therefore, its primary assets are its investments in the common stock of its subsidiaries, including Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois. As a result, Ameren’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock depends on the earnings of its subsidiaries and the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise transfer funds to Ameren. Similarly, Ameren’s ability to service its debt obligations is dependent upon the earnings of operating subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings and other payments, including payments of principal and interest under intercompany indebtedness. The payment of dividends to Ameren by its subsidiaries in turn depends on their results of operations and available cash and other items affecting retained earnings. Ameren’s subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any dividends or make any other distributions (except for payments required pursuant to the terms of intercompany borrowing arrangements and cash payments under the tax allocation agreement) to Ameren. Certain financing agreements, corporate organizational documents, and certain statutory and regulatory requirements may impose restrictions on the ability of Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois to transfer funds to Ameren in the form of cash dividends, loans, or advances. Dynegy’s or its subsidiaries' failure to satisfy certain of their indemnity and other obligations to Ameren in connection with the divestiture of New AER to IPH could have a material adverse effect on Ameren’s results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. In December 2013, Ameren completed the divestiture of New AER to IPH. The transaction agreement between Ameren and IPH requires Ameren, until December 2, 2015, to maintain its financial obligations in existence as of December 2, 2013, under all credit support arrangements or obligations that pertain to New AER and its subsidiaries. Ameren must also provide any additional credit support that may be contractually required pursuant to any of the contracts of New AER, and its subsidiaries as of December 2, 2013. IPH, New AER and its subsidiaries, and Dynegy have agreed to indemnify Ameren for certain losses relating to this credit support. IPH’s indemnification obligations are secured by certain AERG and Genco assets. However, these indemnification obligations and security interests might not cover all losses that could be incurred by Ameren in connection with providing this credit support. As of December 31, 2014, the balance of the Marketing Company note to Ameren was $12 million . Additionally, as of December 31, 2014, Ameren provided $114 million in guarantees and $9 million in letters of credit relating to its credit support of New AER. Dynegy emerged from its Chapter 11 bankruptcy case in 2012. As of December 31, 2014, Dynegy’s credit ratings were sub-investment-grade. IPH, New AER and its subsidiaries also do not have investment-grade credit ratings. Dynegy, IPH, New AER, or their subsidiaries might not be able to satisfy their indemnity and other obligations under the transaction agreement, Marketing Company’s note to 23 Table of Contents Ameren, or Dynegy’s limited guarantee to Ameren, which could have a material adverse impact on Ameren’s results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. Increasing costs associated with our defined benefit retirement and postretirement plans, health care plans, and other employee benefits could adversely affect our financial position and liquidity. We offer defined benefit retirement and postretirement plans that cover substantially all of our employees. Assumptions related to future costs, returns on investments, interest rates, timing of employee retirements, and mortality, as well as other actuarial matters, have a significant impact on our customers' rates and our plan funding requirements. Ameren's total unfunded obligation under its pension and postretirement benefit plans was $710 million as of December 31, 2014. Ameren expects to fund its pension plans at a level equal to the greater of the pension expense or the legally required minimum contribution. Considering Ameren’s assumptions at December 31, 2014, its investment performance in 2014, and its pension funding policy, Ameren expects to make annual contributions of $25 million to $115 million in each of the next five years, with aggregate estimated contributions of $290 million . We expect Ameren Missouri’s and Ameren Illinois’ portion of the future funding requirements to be 41% and 40% , respectively. These amounts are estimates. They may change with actual investment performance, changes in interest rates, changes in our assumptions, changes in government regulations, and any voluntary contributions. In addition to the costs of our retirement plans, the costs of providing health care benefits to our employees and retirees have increased in recent years. We believe that our employee benefit costs, including costs of health care plans for our employees and former employees, will continue to rise. The increasing costs and funding requirements associated with our defined benefit retirement plans, health care plans, and other employee benefits could increase our financing needs and otherwise materially adversely affect our financial position and liquidity.
