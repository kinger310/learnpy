titanium, and nickel, are used worldwide in aircraft, automobiles, commercial transportation, packaging, building and construction, oil and gas, defense, consumer electronics, and industrial applications. Alcoa is also the world leader in the production and management of primary aluminum, fabricated aluminum, and alumina combined, through its active
participation in all major aspects of the industry: technology, mining, refining, smelting, fabricating, and recycling. Aluminum is a commodity that is traded on the London Metal Exchange (LME) and priced daily. Sales of primary aluminum and alumina
represent approximately 40% of Alcoas revenues. The price of aluminum influences the operating results of Alcoa. 1 Alcoa is a global company operating in 30 countries. Based upon the country where the point of sale
occurred, the United States and Europe generated 51% and 27%, respectively, of Alcoas sales in 2014. In addition, Alcoa has investments and operating activities in, among others, Australia, Brazil, China, Guinea, Iceland, Russia, and Saudi
Arabia, all of which present opportunities for substantial growth. Governmental policies, laws and regulations, and other economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, affect the
results of operations in these countries. Alcoas operations consist of four worldwide reportable segments: Alumina, Primary Metals,
Global Rolled Products, and Engineered Products and Solutions.

Segment and Geographic Area Information 132 The following tables and related discussion of the Companys Bauxite Interests, Alumina Refining and Primary
Aluminum Facilities and Capacities, Global Rolled Products, Engineered Products and Solutions and Corporate Facilities provide additional description of Alcoas businesses. The Alumina segment primarily consists of a series of affiliated
operating entities referred to as Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals (AWAC). Alcoa owns 60% and Alumina Limited owns 40% of these individual entities. For more information on AWAC, see Exhibit Nos. 10(a) through 10(f)(1) to this report. Bauxite Interests Aluminum is
one of the most plentiful elements in the earths crust and is produced primarily from bauxite, an ore containing aluminum in the form of aluminum oxide, commonly referred to as alumina. Aluminum is made by extracting alumina from bauxite and
then removing oxygen from the alumina. Alcoa processes most of the bauxite that it mines into alumina. The Company obtains bauxite from its own resources and from those belonging to the AWAC enterprise, located in the countries listed in the table
below, as well as pursuant to both long-term and short-term contracts and mining leases. During 2014, Alcoa consumed 40.8 million metric tons (mt) from AWAC and its own resources and 8.2 million mt from entities in which the Company has an
equity interest. In addition, AWAC sold 1.6 million mt of bauxite to third parties. Tons of bauxite are reported as bone dry metric tons (bdmt) unless otherwise stated. See the glossary of bauxite mining related terms at the end of this
section. The Company has access to large bauxite deposit areas with mining rights that extend in most cases more than 20 years from the date
of this report. For purposes of evaluating the amount of bauxite that will be available to supply as 2 feedstock to its refineries, the Company considers both estimates of bauxite resources as well as calculated bauxite reserves. Bauxite resources represent deposits for which tonnage, densities,
shape, physical characteristics, grade and mineral content can be estimated with a reasonable level of confidence based on the amount of exploration sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as
outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. Bauxite reserves represent the economically mineable part of resource deposits, and include diluting materials and allowances for losses, which may occur when the material is mined. Appropriate
assessments and studies have been carried out to define the reserves, and include consideration of and modification by realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors. Alcoa
employs a conventional approach (including additional drilling with successive tightening of the drill grid) with customized techniques to define and characterize its various bauxite deposit types allowing Alcoa to confidently establish the extent
of its bauxite resources and their ultimate conversion to reserves. The table below only includes the amount of proven and probable reserves
controlled by the Company. While the level of reserves may appear low in relation to annual production levels, they are consistent with historical levels of reserves for the Companys mining locations. Given the Companys extensive bauxite
resources, the abundant supply of bauxite globally and the length of the Companys rights to bauxite, it is not cost-effective to invest the significant resources necessary to establish bauxite reserves that reflect the total size of the
bauxite resources available to the Company. Rather, bauxite resources are upgraded annually to reserves as needed by the location. Detailed assessments are progressively undertaken within a proposed mining area and mine activity is then planned to
achieve a uniform quality in the supply of blended feedstock to the relevant refinery. Alcoa believes its present sources of bauxite on a global basis are sufficient to meet the forecasted requirements of its alumina refining operations for the
foreseeable future. Bauxite Resource Development Guidelines Alcoa has developed best practice guidelines for bauxite reserve and resource classification at its operating bauxite mines. Alcoas reserves are declared in accordance with Alcoas internal
guidelines as administered by the Alcoa Ore Reserves Committee (AORC). The reported ore reserves set forth in the table below are those that Alcoa estimates could be extracted economically with current technology and in current market conditions.
Alcoa does not use a price for bauxite, alumina, or aluminum to determine its bauxite reserves. The primary criteria for determining bauxite reserves are the feed specifications required by the customer alumina refinery. In addition to these
specifications, a number of modifying factors have been applied to differentiate bauxite reserves from other mineralized material. Alcoa mining locations have annual in-fill drilling programs designed to progressively upgrade the reserve and
resource classification of their bauxite. 3 Alcoa Bauxite Interests, Share of Reserves and Annual Production 1 Country Project Owners Mining Rights (% Entitlement) Expiration Date of Mining Rights Probable Reserves (million bdmt) Proven Reserves (million (bdmt) Available Alumina Content (%) AvAl 2 O 3 Reactive Silica Content (%) RxSiO 2 2014 Annual Production (million bdmt) Australia Darling Range Mines ML1SA Alcoa of Australia Limited (AofA) 2 (100%) 2024 43.1 117.8 33.1 0.9 31.4 Brazil Poços de Caldas Alcoa Alumínio S.A.

The concession remains in force until the exhaustion of the
deposit. The Company estimates that (i) the concessions at Poços de Caldas will last at least until 2020, (ii) the concessions at Trombetas will last until 2046 and (iii) the concessions at Juruti will last until 2100.
Depending, however, on actual and future needs, the rate at which the deposits are exploited and government approval is obtained, the concessions may be extended to (or expire at) a later (or an earlier) date. 5 Alcoa World Alumina LLC (AWA LLC) owns 100% of N.V. Alcoa Minerals of Suriname (AMS). Suralco and AMS are parts of the AWAC group of companies which
are owned 60% by Alcoa and 40% by Alumina Limited. 6 The mining rights in the Onverdacht and Coermotibo areas where Suralco has active mines extend until 2033. Bauxite within these areas will likely be
exhausted in the near future. During 2015, Suralco will be mining from both reserves and resources. Alcoa has decided not to develop a mine at the Nassau Plateau based on current refinery cost and market conditions. 4 7 Alumínio holds an 8.58% total interest, AWA Brasil holds a 4.62% total interest and AWA LLC holds a 5% total interest in MRN. MRN is jointly
owned with affiliates of Rio Tinto Alcan Inc., Companhia Brasileira de Alumínio, Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, BHP Billiton Plc (BHP Billiton) and Norsk Hydro. Alumínio, AWA Brasil, and AWA LLC purchase bauxite from MRN under long-term
supply contracts. 8 AWA LLC owns a 45% interest in Halco (Mining), Inc. (Halco). Halco owns 100% of Boké Investment Company, a Delaware company, which owns 51% of
CBG. The Guinean Government owns 49% of CBG, which has the exclusive right through 2038 to develop and mine bauxite in certain areas within a 10,000 square-mile concession in northwestern Guinea. 9 AWA LLC has a bauxite purchase contract with CBG that expires in 2029. Before that expiration date, AWA LLC expects to negotiate an extension of the
contract as CBG will have concession rights until 2038. The CBG concession can be renewed beyond 2038 by agreement of the Government of Guinea and CBG should more time be required to commercialize the remaining economic bauxite within the
concession. 10 GuineaBoké: CBG prices bauxite and plans the mine based on the bauxite qualities of total alumina (TAl 2 O 3 ) and total silica (TSiO 2 ). 11 Maaden Bauxite & Alumina Company is a joint venture owned by Saudi Arabian Mining Company (Maaden) (74.9%) and AWA Saudi
Limited (25.1%). AWA Saudi Limited is part of the AWAC group of companies and is owned 60% by Alcoa and 40% by Alumina Limited. 12 Kingdom of Saudi ArabiaAl Baitha: Bauxite reserves and mine plans are based on the bauxite qualities of total available alumina (TAA) and

Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data). In November 2005, AWA LLC and Rio Tinto Alcan Inc. signed
a Basic Agreement with the Government of Guinea that sets forth the framework for development of a 1.5 million mtpy alumina refinery in Guinea. In 2006, the Basic Agreement was approved by the Guinean National Assembly and was promulgated into
law. The Basic Agreement was originally set to expire in November 2008, but was extended to November 2015. Pre-feasibility studies were completed in 2008. Additional feasibility study work was completed in 2012. Alcoa continued its evaluation
of the project in 2014. 10 In September 2006, Alcoa received environmental approval from the Government of Western Australia for
expansion of the Wagerup alumina refinery to a maximum capacity of 4.7 million mtpy, a potential increase of over 2 million mtpy. This approval had a term of 5 years and included environmental conditions that must be satisfied before Alcoa
could seek construction approval for the project. The project was suspended in November 2008 due to global economic conditions and the unavailability of a secure long-term energy supply in Western Australia. These constraints continue and as such
the project remains under suspension. In May 2012, the Government of Western Australia granted Alcoa a 5 year extension of the original environmental approval. There were no material developments in 2014. In 2008, AWAC signed a cooperation agreement with Vietnam National Coal-Minerals Industries Group (Vinacomin) in which they agreed to conduct a joint
feasibility study of the Gia Nghia bauxite mine and alumina refinery project located in Vietnams Central Highlands. The cooperation between AWAC and Vinacomin on Gia Nghia is subject to approval by the Government of Vietnam. If established,
the Gia Nghia venture is expected to be 51% owned by Vinacomin, 40% by AWAC and 9% by others. There were no material developments in 2014. Primary Aluminum Facilities and Capacity The Companys primary aluminum smelters and their respective capacities are shown in the following table: Alcoa Worldwide Smelting Capacity Country Facility Owners (% Of Ownership) Nameplate Capacity 1 (000 MTPY) Alcoa Consolidated Capacity 2 (000 MTPY) Australia Portland AofA (55%) CITIC 3 (22.5%) Marubeni 3 (22.5%) 358 197 4,5 Brazil Poços de Caldas Alumínio (100%) 96 96 6 São Luís (Alumar) Alumínio (60%) BHP Billiton 3 (40%) 447 268 6 Canada Baie Comeau, Québec Alcoa (100%) 280 7 280 Bécancour, Québec Alcoa (74.95%) Rio Tinto Alcan

production. 2 The figures in this column reflect Alcoas share of production from these facilities. 3 The named company or an affiliate holds this interest. 11 4 This figure includes the minority interest of Alumina Limited in the Portland facility, which is owned by AofA. From this facility, Alcoa takes 100% of
the production allocated to AofA. 5 The Portland smelter has approximately 30,000 mtpy of idle capacity. 6 In 2013, Alcoa temporarily curtailed 34,000 mtpy at the Poços de Caldas smelter and 97,000 mtpy at the Alumar smelter. In the first quarter of
2014, management initiated the temporary curtailment of the remaining 62,000 mtpy at the Poços de Caldas smelter and an additional 85,000 mtpy at the Alumar smelter. The process of curtailing this additional capacity began in March 2014 and
was completed by the end of May 2014. In the 2014 third quarter, an additional 12,000 mtpy was curtailed at the Alumar smelter. 7 In mid-May 2013, in connection with the announcement of a revised modernization plan schedule for the Baie-Comeau smelter, Alcoa stated that it would
permanently close the plants two Soderberg potlines. The closure, which was completed in August 2013, involved 105,000 mtpy of capacity and was part of the 460,000 mtpy of smelting capacity Alcoa announced was under review in May 2013. 8 Owned through Rio Tinto Alcan Inc.s interest in Pechiney Reynolds Québec, Inc., which is owned by Rio Tinto Alcan Inc. and Alcoa. 9 The Avilés and La Coruña smelters have approximately 64,000 mtpy of idle capacity combined. 10 The Rockdale smelter has been fully curtailed since the end of 2008. 11 The Intalco smelter has approximately 49,000 mtpy of idle capacity. 12 The Wenatchee smelter has approximately 41,000 mtpy of idle capacity. As of December 31, 2014, Alcoa had approximately 665,000 mtpy of idle capacity against total Alcoa Consolidated Capacity of 3,497,000 mtpy. In May 2013, Alcoa announced that management would review 460,000 mtpy of smelting capacity over a 15-month period for possible curtailment. This review was aimed at maintaining Alcoas
competitiveness despite falling aluminum prices and would focus on the highest-cost smelting capacity and those plants that have long-term risk due to factors such as energy costs or regulatory uncertainty. As part of this review during the
remainder of 2013, management initiated the permanent shutdown of 146,000 mtpy of combined capacity at the Baie Comeau smelter (see footnote 7 above) and the Massena East smelter in New York, as well as a temporary curtailment of 131,000 mtpy of
capacity in Brazil (see footnote 6 above). All of these actions were completed in 2013. In June 2013, Alcoa announced its intention to
permanently close the Fusina, Italy smelter. The closure was in addition to the 460,000 mtpy of operating smelting capacity that the company announced was under review in May 2013. During the first quarter of 2014, the Company initiated three additional actions, resulting in the permanent shutdown of 274,000 mtpy of capacity and the temporary curtailment of 147,000 mtpy of capacity.
The permanent shutdowns were comprised of the remaining capacity (84,000 mtpy) at the Massena East smelter and the full capacity (190,000 mtpy) at the Point Henry smelter in Australia. The remaining capacity of the Massena East smelter represented
two Soderberg potlines that were no longer competitive. This shutdown was completed by the end of the 2014 first quarter. For the Point Henry smelter, the Company determined that the smelter had no prospect of becoming financially viable. The
shutdown of the Point Henry smelter was completed in August 2014. In the third quarter of 2014, management approved the permanent shutdown of
the Portovesme smelter (150,000 mtpy) in Italy, which has been idle since November 2012. This decision was made because the fundamental reasons that made the Portovesme smelter uncompetitive remained unchanged, including the lack of a viable
long-term power solution. In the fourth quarter of 2014, Alcoa sold its 50.3% interest (115,000 mtpy) in the Mount Holly smelter in Goose
Creek, South Carolina, to Century Aluminum Company. As a result of the above-described actions, the Massena East, Mount Holly, Point Henry
and Portovesme smelters have not been included in the table above. As noted above, Alcoa and Maaden have developed an aluminum smelter
in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The smelter has an initial capacity of ingot, slab and billet of 740,000 mtpy. First hot metal was produced on December 12, 2012, and the smelter produced 600,000 mt in 2014. Since mid-2014, the smelter has been
operating at full capacity. 12 In November 2014, Alcoa completed the sale of an aluminum rod plant located in Bécancour,
Québec, Canada to Sural Laminated Products. This facility takes molten aluminum and shapes it into the form of a rod, which is used by customers primarily for the transportation of electricity. In conjunction with this transaction, Alcoa
entered into a multi-year agreement with Sural Laminated Products to supply molten aluminum for the rod plant. In 2014, Alcoa and the Brunei
Economic Development Board agreed to extend for four years an existing Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to enable more detailed studies into the feasibility of establishing a modern, gas-powered aluminum smelter in Brunei Darussalam to follow a
period of strategic assessment of global market conditions. In 2007, Alcoa and Greenland Home Rule Government entered into an MOU regarding
cooperation on a feasibility study for an aluminum smelter with a 360,000 mtpy capacity in Greenland. The MOU also encompasses a hydroelectric power system and related infrastructure improvements, including a port. In November 2014, following new
elections in Greenland, the new parliament began a review of framework legislation affecting large scale developmental projects. Once completed, the impact of the review on the economic feasibility of the proposed integrated hydro system-aluminum
smelter will be evaluated. Global Rolled Products The principal business of the Companys Global Rolled Products segment is the production and sale of aluminum plate, sheet, and specialty foil. This segment includes sheet and plate used in
aerospace, automotive, brazing, commercial transportation, consumer electronics, building and construction and other industrial markets. This segment also includes rigid container sheet, which is sold directly to customers in the food and beverage
packaging markets. The Companys $300 million expansion of its Tennessee Operations continued and the $300 million expansion of its
Davenport Works, Iowa plant was completed in 2014. Both expansions will support the manufacture of high strength aluminum automotive sheet. Also in 2014, Alcoa announced a $190 million investment at its Davenport Works facility to expand its product
offerings in the aerospace and industrial markets through the installation of technology that will enhance the performance of thick aluminum and aluminum-lithium plate in various applications such as wing ribs and fuselage frames. Construction on
the project will begin in 2015 with first customer production expected to begin in 2017. Also in 2014, Alcoa announced a $40 million
investment in its Itapissuma, Brazil rolling mill to increase production of specialty foils for aseptic and flexible packages. Initial work for the expansion is underway and commissioning is expected to begin in 2016. In December 2014, Alcoa sold its facilities in Amorebieta and Alicante (Spain) and Castelsarrasin (France), as well as the associated research and
development facility in Alicante to Atlas Holdings LLC. Alcoa permanently closed its two rolling mills in Australia located in Geelong,
Victoria and in Yennora, New South Wales in the fourth quarter of 2014. The two rolling mills served the domestic and Asian can sheet markets, which have been impacted by excess capacity. In September 2014, Alcoa announced a long-term contract to supply aluminum sheet and plate products to Boeing, the worlds largest aerospace company and leading manufacturer of commercial jetliners
and defense, space and security systems. The multiyear contract, valued at more than $1 billion, is the largest ever between the two companies. In September 2014, Alcoa and China Power Investment Corporation (CPI) temporarily suspended joint venture activities undertaken by the joint venture,
which the parties had established in 2012, so that CPI could focus on its merger with the State Nuclear Power Technology Corporation. This includes suspension of the integration of three Alcoa businesses (a facility in Kunshan, China that
manufactures brazing sheet; a facility in Qinhuangdao, China that manufactures beverage can sheet and sheet for commercial transportation; and a fastener facility in Suzhou, China). The joint venture company, Alcoa CPI Aluminum Investment Co. Ltd,
is majority owned by Alcoa and headquartered in Shanghai, China. 13 In December 2014, Alcoa unveiled breakthrough manufacturing technology, the Alcoa
Micromill TM , that will manufacture the most advanced
aluminum sheet on the market. The Alcoa-patented Micromill process changes the microstructure of the metal, allowing the production of an aluminum alloy for automotive applications that has 40 percent greater formability and 30 percent greater
strength than the incumbent aluminum used today while meeting stringent automotive surface quality requirements. Additionally, automotive parts made with Micromill material will be twice as formable and at least 30 percent lighter than parts made
from high strength steel. The Micromill will enable the next generation of automotive aluminum products, and equip Alcoa to capture growing demand. As noted above, Alcoa and Maaden have developed a rolling mill in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The rolling mill, which is 74 acres under one roof, is operational and will manufacture a variety of
sheet products. In 2014, Alcoa bought out the 30% interest in the Kunshan brazing sheet facility for $28 million from its partner, Shanxi
Yuncheng Engraving Group, and the parties terminated the joint venture in August 2014. Alcoa also reached agreement on the terms of sale for its remaining minority interest (17.96%) in Yunnan Xaoxin Aluminum Foil joint venture for approximately
$15 million. The sale is awaiting approval by the China Securities Regulatory Commission.

Engineered Products and Solutions This segment represents Alcoas downstream operations and includes titanium, super alloy investment, and aluminum castings; fasteners; aluminum wheels; integrated aluminum structural systems;
architectural extrusions; and forgings and hard alloy extrusions. These products, which are used in the aerospace, automotive, building and construction, commercial transportation, power generation, and industrial markets, are sold directly to
customers and through distributors. 14 Alcoa completed the acquisition of Firth Rixson, a global leader in aerospace jet engine components, in
fourth quarter 2014. In addition to manufacturing jet engine rings, Firth Rixson manufactures a full range of forged complex shapes and is a supplier of integrated nickel ingot. Firth Rixson has five locations in the United States (Rochester, NY;
Fontana, CA; Rancho Cucamonga, CA; Verdi, NV, and Savannah, GA) and eight locations outside of the United States (United Kingdom, Hungary and China). In December 2014, Alcoa announced a definitive agreement to acquire TITAL, a privately held company based in Germany. TITAL is a leader in titanium and aluminum structural castings for aircraft engines
and airframes. In addition, TITAL is a leader in process technology. The deal is expected to close in first quarter 2015. Also in December
2014, Alcoa announced plans to double its high-technology coating capacity at its Whitehall, Michigan facility. The $17 million investment will position the Company to further capture growing demand for advanced jet engine parts. In 2014, Alcoa
commenced an expansion at its Hampton, Virginia facility to create the capability to employ a new process technology that improves jet engine blades. This $25 million investment will add equipment for a new production line and modify existing
machinery to produce the blades. It is expected to be complete by the fourth quarter of 2015. In 2014, Alcoa completed construction of a $100
million greenfield facility adjacent to its Lafayette, Indiana plant, which expands Alcoas aluminum lithium capabilities. The facility can produce more than 20,000 mt of aluminum lithium and is capable of casting round and rectangular ingot
for rolled, extruded, and forged applications. Alcoa completed expanding aluminum lithium production at its Technical Center in Alcoa Center, PA in the third quarter of 2012. In June 2013, Alcoa also completed its expansion at its Kitts Green plant
in the United Kingdom, creating additional aluminum lithium casting capacity. Also in 2014, Alcoa broke ground on its $100 million aerospace
expansion at its La Porte, Indiana facility where it will produce nickel-based superalloy jet engine parts. The new 320,000-square-foot facility will expand Alcoas reach from structural engine components for business and regional jets to large
commercial aircraft, including narrow- and wide-body and military airplanes. Construction is expected to be complete by the fourth quarter of 2015. Alcoa invested $13 million to expand its wheel manufacturing plant in Europe, to meet growing demand for its lightweight, durable, low-maintenance aluminum truck wheels. Construction on the production
line expansion began in January 2014, and was completed on schedule in January 2015. Alcoa and VSMPO-AVISMA Corporation signed a cooperation
agreement in October 2013, which will allow the companies to meet growing demand for high-end titanium and aluminum products for aircraft manufacturers worldwide. Once operational, the new joint venture will focus on manufacturing high-end aerospace
products, such as landing gear and forged wing components, at Alcoas plant in Samara, Russia. The definitive Shareholders Agreement was executed by the parties on July 16, 2014, and the deal is expected to close in 2015, with the
joint venture expected to become operational in 2016. As discussed above, the joint venture between Alcoa and CPI, which the parties created
in November 2012 to produce high-end fabricated aluminum products in China, is currently suspended. In July 2014, Alcoa announced a 10-year,
$1.1 billion agreement with Pratt & Whitney, a division of United Technologies Corp., for state-of-the-art jet engine components. 15 Engineered Products and Solutions Principal Facilities Country Facility Owners 1 (% Of Ownership) Products Australia Oakleigh Alcoa (100%) Fasteners Canada Georgetown, Ontario 2 Alcoa (100%) Aerospace Castings Laval, Québec Alcoa (100%) Aerospace Castings Lethbridge, Alberta Alcoa (100%) Architectural Products Pointe Claire, Québec Alcoa (100%) Architectural Products Vaughan, Ontario 2 Alcoa (100%) Architectural Products China Suzhou 2 Alcoa (100%) Fasteners and Rings France Dives-sur-Mer Alcoa (100%) Aerospace and Industrial Gas Turbine Castings Evron Alcoa (100%) Aerospace and Specialty Castings Gennevilliers Alcoa (100%) Aerospace and Industrial Gas Turbine Castings Guérande 2 Alcoa (100%) Architectural Products Lézat-sur-Lèze 2 Alcoa (100%) Architectural Products Merxheim 2 Alcoa (100%) Architectural Products Montbrison Alcoa (100%) Fasteners St. Cosme-en-Vairais 2 Alcoa (100%) Fasteners Toulouse Alcoa (100%) Fasteners Us-par-Vigny Alcoa (100%) Fasteners Vendargues 2 Alcoa (100%) Architectural Products Germany Hannover 2 Alcoa (100%) Extrusions Hildesheim-Bavenstedt 2 Alcoa (100%) Fasteners Iserlohn Alcoa (100%) Architectural Products Kelkheim 2 Alcoa (100%) Fasteners Hungary Eger Alcoa (100%) Forgings Nemesvámos Alcoa (100%) Fasteners Székesfehérvár Alcoa (100%) Aerospace and Industrial Gas Turbine Castings and Forgings Japan Jōetsu City 2 Alcoa (100%) Forgings Nomi Alcoa (100%) Aerospace and Industrial Gas Turbine Castings Netherlands Harderwijk 2 Alcoa (100%) Architectural Products Mexico Ciudad Acuña 2 Alcoa (100%) Aerospace Castings/Fasteners Monterrey Alcoa (100%) Forgings Morocco Casablanca 2 Alcoa (100%) Fasteners Casablanca 2 Alcoa (67%) Ahmed Hattabi (33%) Architectural Products Russia Belaya Kalitva 3 Alcoa (100%) Extrusions and Forgings Samara 3 Alcoa (100%) Extrusions and Forgings South Korea Kyoungnam Alcoa (100%) Extrusions Spain Irutzun 2 Alcoa (100%) Architectural Products 16 Country Facility Owners 1 (% Of Ownership) Products United Kingdom Darley Dale Alcoa (100%) Forgings Ecklesfield Alcoa (100%) Ingot Castings Exeter 2 Alcoa (100%) Aerospace and Industrial Gas Turbine Castings and Alloy Glossop Alcoa (100%) Ingot Castings Ickles Alcoa (100%) Ingot Castings Leicester 2 Alcoa (100%) Fasteners Meadow Hall Alcoa (100%) Forgings Provincial Park Alcoa (100%) Forgings Redditch 2 Alcoa (100%) Fasteners River Don Alcoa (100%) Forgings Runcorn Alcoa (100%) Architectural Products Telford Alcoa (100%) Fasteners United States Springdale, AR 2 Alcoa (100%) Architectural Products Chandler, AZ Alcoa (100%) Extrusions Tucson, AZ 2 Alcoa (100%) Fasteners Carson, CA 2 Alcoa (100%) Fasteners City of Industry, CA 2 Alcoa (100%) Fasteners Fontana, CA Alcoa (100%) Rings Fullerton, CA 2 Alcoa (100%) Fasteners Newbury Park, CA Alcoa (100%) Fasteners Rancho Cucamonga, CA Alcoa (100%) Rings Savannah, GA Alcoa (100%) Forgings Sylmar, CA Alcoa (100%) Fasteners Torrance, CA Alcoa (100%) Fasteners Visalia, CA Alcoa (100%) Architectural Products Branford, CT Alcoa (100%) Aerospace Coatings Winsted, CT Alcoa (100%) Aerospace Machining Eastman, GA Alcoa (100%) Architectural Products Lafayette, IN Alcoa (100%) Extrusions LaPorte, IN Alcoa (100%) Aerospace and Industrial Gas Turbine Castings Baltimore, MD 2 Alcoa (100%) Extrusions Whitehall, MI Alcoa (100%) Aerospace/Industrial Gas Turbine Castings Coatings/Ti Alloy and Specialty

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials The major raw materials purchased in 2014 for each of the Companys reportable segments are listed below. Alumina Global Rolled Products Bauxite Alloying materials Caustic soda Aluminum scrap Electricity Coatings Fuel oil Electricity Lime (CaO) Natural gas Natural gas Primary aluminum (ingot, billet, P1020, high purity) Steam Primary Metals Engineered Products and Solutions Alloying materials Alloying materials Alumina Electricity Aluminum fluoride Natural gas Calcined petroleum coke Nickel Cathode blocks Primary aluminum (ingot, billet, P1020, high purity) Electricity Resin Liquid pitch Stainless Steel Natural gas Steel Titanium 18 Generally, other materials are purchased from third-party suppliers under competitively priced supply
contracts or bidding arrangements. The Company believes that the raw materials necessary to its business are and will continue to be available. For each metric ton of alumina produced, Alcoa consumes the following amounts of the identified raw material inputs (approximate range across relevant
facilities): Raw Material Units Consumption per MT of Alumina Bauxite mt 2.2  3.7 Caustic soda kg 62  117 Electricity kWh 200  260 (global average of 230) Fuel oil and natural gas GJ 6.3  11.6 Lime

types of elements that can be used to produce Alcoas various alloys, providing a range of such elements would not be meaningful. With the exception of a very small number of internally used products, Alcoa produces its alloys in adherence to
an Aluminum Association standard. The Aluminum Association, of which Alcoa is an active member, uses a specific designation system to identify alloy types. In general, each alloy type has a major alloying element other than aluminum but will also
have other constituents as well, but of lesser amounts. Energy Employing the Bayer Process, Alcoa refines alumina from bauxite ore. Alcoa then produces aluminum from the alumina by an electrolytic process requiring substantial amounts of electric power. Energy
accounts for approximately 21% of the Companys total alumina refining production costs. Electric power accounts for approximately 26% of the Companys primary aluminum production costs. Alcoa generates approximately 25% of the power used
at its smelters worldwide and generally purchases the remainder under long-term arrangements. The paragraphs below summarize the sources of power and the long-term power arrangements for Alcoas smelters and refineries. North America  Electricity The Deschambault, Baie Comeau, and Bécancour smelters in Québec purchased electricity under existing contracts that expired on December 31, 2014. These were replaced by new long-term
contracts with Hydro-Québec executed in October 2014 (Deschambault and Baie Comeau smelters) and December 2014 (Bécancour smelter), both of which will expire on December 31, 2029. Upon expiration, Alcoa will have the option of
extending the term of the new Baie 19 Comeau contract to February 23, 2036. The smelter located in Baie Comeau, Québec purchases approximately 74% of its power needs under the Hydro-Québec contract, and the
remainder from a 40% owned hydroelectric generating company, Manicouagan Power Limited Partnership. The Companys wholly-owned
subsidiary, Alcoa Power Generating Inc. (APGI), generates approximately 35% of the power requirements for Alcoas smelters operating in the U.S. The Company purchases power under long-term contracts. APGI owns and operates the Yadkin
hydroelectric project, consisting of four dams in North Carolina, and the Warrick coal-fired power plant located in Indiana. For several
years, APGI has been pursuing a new long-term license for the Yadkin hydroelectric project from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). In 2007, APGI filed with FERC a Relicensing Settlement Agreement signed by a majority of interested
stakeholders that broadly resolved open issues. The National Environmental Policy Act process is complete, with a final environmental impact statement having been issued in April 2008. The remaining requirement for relicensing was the issuance by
North Carolina of the required water quality certification under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act. North Carolinas Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) issued a Section 401 water quality certification on
May 7, 2009, but it was appealed and then stayed. In September 2012, APGI filed a new application for a 401 certificate seeking a fresh review of its application. However, on August 2, 2013, the State of North Carolina filed suit in state
court seeking a declaratory ruling that it, not APGI, owns the Yadkin riverbed beneath the hydroelectric project as well as a portion of the project dams. Upon the filing of the lawsuit, the DENR denied APGIs 401 certificate, asserting
that it cannot review the application given the dispute over ownership of the lands and the project. APGI has appealed that denial in the administrative court of North Carolina and has also informed FERC of the appeal, a necessary step to
demonstrate that the relicensing proceeding remains pending before FERC. APGI removed the riverbed lawsuit to federal court in 2013. On November 20, 2014, the court denied APGIs motion for summary judgment and partially granted and
partially denied North Carolinas motion for partial summary judgment. A pre-trial conference was held on February 2, 2015. The court has ordered trial to commence on April 21, 2015. Pending completion of the relicensing process, APGI received year-to-year license renewals from FERC starting in May 2008, and will continue to operate
under annual licenses until a new Section 401 certification is issued and the FERC relicensing process is complete. Since the permanent closure of the Badin, North Carolina smelter, power generated from APGIs Yadkin system is largely
being sold to an affiliate, Alcoa Power Marketing LLC, and then the wholesale market. APGI generates substantially all of the power used at
the Companys Warrick, Indiana smelter using nearby coal reserves. Since May 2005, Alcoa has owned the nearby Friendsville, Illinois coal reserves, with the Friendsville Mine being operated by Vigo Coal Company, Inc. The Friendsville Mine is
producing approximately one million tons of coal per year. In June 2011, the Red Brush West Mine, owned by Alcoa and operated by Vigo Coal, was opened and produced approximately 60,000 tons per month over an eighteen-month period, but operation
ceased in 2013. In the second quarter of 2013, Liberty Mine, also owned by Alcoa and operated by Vigo Coal, began producing coal and is operating at a level of approximately one million tons per year. Friendsville and Liberty Mines together combine
to supply 95% of the power plants future needs. The balance of the coal used is royalty coal or purchased coal from the Illinois basin. In the State of Washington, Alcoas Wenatchee smelter operates under a contract with Chelan County Public Utility District (Chelan PUD) under which
Alcoa receives approximately 26% of the hydropower output of Chelan PUDs Rocky Reach and Rock Island dams. Starting on January 1,
2013, the Intalco smelter began receiving physical power from the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) pursuant to a new contract executed between Alcoa and BPA, under which Alcoa receives physical power at the Northwest Power Act mandated
industrial firm power (IP) rate through September 30, 2022. 20 Prior to 2007, power for the Rockdale smelter in Texas was historically supplied from Company-owned
generating units and units owned by Luminant Generation Company LLC (formerly TXU Generation Company LP) (Luminant), both of which used lignite supplied by the Companys Sandow Mine. Upon completion of lignite mining in the Sandow Mine in 2005,
lignite supply transitioned to the formerly Alcoa-owned Three Oaks Mine. The Company retired its three wholly-owned generating units at Rockdale (Sandow Units 1, 2 and 3) in late 2006, and transitioned to an arrangement under which Luminant is to
supply all of the Rockdale smelters electricity requirements under a long-term power contract that does not expire until at least the end of 2038, with the parties having the right to terminate the contract after 2013 if there has been an
unfavorable change in law or after 2025 if the cost of the electricity exceeds the market price. In August 2007, Luminant and Alcoa closed on the definitive agreements under which Luminant has constructed and operates a new circulating fluidized bed
power plant (Sandow Unit 5) adjacent to the existing Sandow Unit 4 and, in September 2007, on the sale of Three Oaks Mine to Luminant. Concurrent with entering into the agreements under which Luminant constructed and operates Sandow Unit 5, Alcoa
and Luminant entered into a power purchase agreement whereby Alcoa purchased power from Luminant. That Sandow Unit 5 power purchase agreement was terminated by Alcoa, effective December 1, 2010. In June 2008, Alcoa temporarily idled half of the
capacity at the Rockdale smelter and in November 2008 curtailed the remainder of Rockdales smelting capacity. In late 2011, Alcoa announced that it would permanently close two of the six idled potlines at its Rockdale, Texas smelter.
Demolition and remediation activities related to these actions began in the first half of 2012 and were completed in 2013. On April 29, 2014, Luminant Generation LLC, Luminant Mining Company LLC, Sandow Power Company LLC and their affiliated
debtors filed petitions under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code with the U.S Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. As of the date of this report, the debtors have not yet filed proposed plans of reorganization and have not yet moved to
assume or reject the Sandow Unit 4 agreement or certain other related agreements with the Company. In the Northeast, the Massena West smelter
in New York receives physical power from the New York Power Authority (NYPA) pursuant to a contract between Alcoa and NYPA, which expires in 2045. The contract was amended in January 2011 to provide Alcoa with additional time to complete the
design and engineering work for its Massena East modernization plan, and further amended in March 2014 to provide for the temporary relinquishment of certain quantities of power by Alcoa following permanent closure of the remaining two Soderberg
potlines at the Massena East smelter in March 2014. Implementation of the Massena East modernization plan is subject to further approval of the Alcoa Board of Directors. Australia  Electricity In 2014 the Company concluded it would permanently close the
Point Henry smelter, coinciding with the expiration of the electricity contract with the State Electricity Commission of Victoria (SECV). AofAs Anglesea power station continues to operate and sells electricity into the National Electricity
Market (NEM) after successfully being registered as a scheduled market generator in August 2014. The Portland smelter continues to purchase electricity from the SECV under a contract with Alcoa Portland Aluminium Pty Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary
of AofA, that extends to 2016. Upon the expiration of this contract, the Portland smelter will purchase power from the NEM variable spot market. In March 2010, AofA and Eastern Aluminium (Portland) Pty Ltd separately entered into a fixed for
floating swap contract with AGL Energy in order to manage their exposure to the variable energy rates from the NEM. The fixed for floating swap contract with AGL for the Point Henry smelter was terminated in 2013. The fixed for floating swap
contract with Loy Yang Power for the Portland smelter commences from the date of expiration of the current contract with the SECV and continues until December 2036. Brazil  Electricity Since May 2014 (after full curtailment of the Poços de
Caldas smelter and two of three lines of the Alumar smelter), the remaining smelting capacity at Alumar has been supplied by self-generation. The excess generation capacity has been sold into the market since then (around 350 MW). Alumínio owns a 25.74% stake in Consórcio Machadinho, which is the owner of the Machadinho hydroelectric power plant located in southern
Brazil. 21 Alumínio has a 42.18% interest in Energética Barra Grande S.A.(BAESA), which built the Barra
Grande hydroelectric power plant in southern Brazil. Alumínio also has a 34.97% share in Serra do Facão Energia S.A. (SEFAC),
which built the Serra do Facão hydroelectric power plant in the southeast of Brazil, which began commercial generation in July 2010. Alumínios share of the Serra do Facão output is currently being sold into the market. Alumínio is also participating in the Estreito hydropower project in northern Brazil, through Estreito Energia S.A. (an
Alumínio wholly owned company) holding a 25.49% stake in Consórcio Estreito Energia, which is the owner of the hydroelectric power plant. Consortia in which Alumínio participates have received concessions for the Pai Querê hydropower project in southern Brazil (Alumínios share is 35%). Development of this
concession has not yet begun. Europe  Electricity Alcoas smelters at San Ciprián, La Coruña and Avilés, Spain purchase electricity under bilateral power contracts that commenced on January 1, 2013. The contracts for San
Ciprián and Avilés smelters each have a four-year term (expiring December 31, 2016). The contract for the La Coruña smelter, which expired on December 31, 2014, has been extended for an additional year (expiring
December 31, 2015). Prior to the establishment of power supply under the bilateral contracts, Alcoa was supplied under a regulated power
tariff. On January 25, 2007, the European Commission (EC) announced that it had opened an investigation to establish whether the regulated electricity tariffs granted by Spain comply with European Union (EU) state aid rules. Alcoa operated in
Spain for more than ten years under a power supply structure approved by the Spanish Government in 1986, an equivalent tariff having been granted in 1983. The investigation was limited to the year 2005 and it is focused both on the energy-intensive
consumers and the distribution companies. It is Alcoas understanding that the Spanish tariff system for electricity is in conformity with all applicable laws and regulations, and therefore no state aid is present in that tariff system. On
February 4, 2014, the EC announced a decision in this matter stating that the electricity tariffs granted by Spain for year 2005 do not constitute unlawful state aid. Due to the high cost position of the La Coruña and Avilés
smelters, combined with rising raw material costs and falling aluminum prices, in early January 2012, Alcoa announced its intentions to partially and temporarily curtail its La Coruña and Avilés, Spain smelters. The partial
curtailments were completed in the first half of 2012. As a result of a modification to the load interruptibility regime currently in place in the Spanish power market, in the first quarter of 2013, Alcoa restarted a portion (25,000 mpty combined
for Avilés and La Coruña) of the capacity previously curtailed in the first half of 2012 to meet the requirements of the modified interruptibility regime. See the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations section for more information. A competitive bidding mechanism to allocate interruptibility rights in Spain was settled
during 2014 to be applied starting from January 1, 2015. The first auction process to allocate rights took place in November 2014, where Alcoa secured 275MW of interruptibility rights for the 2015 period for the San Ciprián smelter. A
second auction process took place in December 2014, where Alcoa secured an additional 100MW of interruptibility rights for the 2015 period for the San Ciprián smelter (20x5MW), 120MW for the La Coruña smelter (24x5MW) and 110MW
for the Avilés smelter (22x5MW). Alcoa owns two smelters in Norway, Lista and Mosjøen, which have long-term power arrangements
in place that continue until the end of 2019. 22 Iceland  Electricity Alcoas Fjarðaál smelter in eastern Iceland began operation in 2007. Central to those operations is a forty-year power contract under which Landsvirkjun, the Icelandic national power
company, built the Kárahnjúkar dam and hydropower project, and supplies competitively priced electricity to the smelter. In late 2009, Iceland imposed two new taxes on power intensive industries, both for a period of three years, from
2010 through 2012. One tax is based on energy consumption; the other is a pre-payment of certain other charges, and will be recoverable starting in 2018. In 2012, Iceland extended the energy consumption tax though 2015. Spain  Natural Gas In order to facilitate the full conversion of the San Ciprian, Spain alumina refinery from fuel oil to natural gas, in October 2013, Alumina Española SA (AE) and Gas Natural Transporte SDG SL (GN)
signed a take or pay gas pipeline utilization agreement. Pursuant to that agreement, the ultimate shareholders of AE, Alcoa Inc. and Alumina Limited, have agreed to guarantee the payment of AEs contracted gas pipeline utilization over the
four years of the commitment period in the event AE fails to do so, each shareholder being responsible for its respective proportionate share (i.e., 60/40). Such commitment will come into force six months after the gas pipeline is put into
operation by GN. The gas pipeline was completed in January 2015 and the refinery has switched to natural gas consumption for 100% of its needs. Three supply contracts were signed in 2014 for the supply of natural gas to the San Ciprián, Spain alumina refinery during 2015 period with
Endesa, Union Fenosa Gas and BP, expiring by April 2016, December 2015 and December 2015, respectively. Pursuant to those agreements, Alcoa Inversiones España, S.L. and Alumina Limited have agreed to guarantee the payment of AEs
obligations under the Endesa contract over the contract length, each shareholder being responsible for its respective proportionate share (i.e., 60/40). In the same way, Aluminio Español, S.A. and Alumina Limited have agreed to guarantee the
payment of AEs obligations under the Union Fenosa Gas and BP contract over those contracts respective lengths, with each entity being responsible for its proportionate share (i.e., 60/40). North America  Natural Gas In order to supply its refinery and smelters in the U.S. and Canada, Alcoa generally procures natural gas on a competitive bid basis from a variety of sources including producers in the gas production
areas and independent gas marketers. For Alcoas larger consuming locations in Canada and the U.S., the gas commodity and the interstate pipeline transportation are procured to provide increased flexibility and reliability. Contract pricing for
gas is typically based on a published industry index or New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) price. The Company may choose to reduce its exposure to NYMEX pricing by hedging a portion of required natural gas consumption. Australia  Natural Gas Alcoa holds a 20% equity interest in the Dampier-to-Bunbury natural gas pipeline (this interest was purchased in October 2004). This pipeline transports gas from the northwest gas fields to Alcoas
alumina refineries and other users in the Southwest of Western Australia. Alcoa uses gas to co-generate steam and electricity for its alumina refining processes at the Kwinana, Pinjarra and Wagerup refineries. More than 90% of Alcoas gas
requirements for the remainder of the decade are secured under long-term contracts. Alcoa is considering multiple supply options to replace expiring contracts, including investing directly in projects that have the potential to deliver cost-based
gas. 23 Energy Facilities The following table sets forth the electricity generation capacity and 2014 generation of facilities in which the Company has an ownership interest: Country Facility Alcoa Consolidated Capacity (MW) 1 2014 Generation (MWh) Australia Anglesea 150 1,183,527 Brazil Barra Grande 156 1,803,245 Estreito 157 1,334,943 Machadinho 119 1,801,779 Serra do Facão 60 302,954 Canada Manicouagan 132 1,165,161 Suriname Afobaka 189 806,428 United

Patents, Trade Secrets and Trademarks The Company believes that its domestic and international patent, trade secret and trademark assets provide it with a significant competitive advantage. The Companys rights under its patents, as well
as the products made and sold under them, are important to the Company as a whole and, to varying degrees, important to each business segment. The patents owned by Alcoa generally concern particular products or manufacturing equipment or techniques.
Alcoas business as a whole is not, however, materially dependent on any single patent, trade secret or trademark. As a result of product development and technological advancement, the Company continues to pursue patent protection in
jurisdictions throughout the world. At the end of 2014, the Companys worldwide patent portfolio consisted of approximately 831 pending patent applications and 1,981 granted patents. The Company has a number of trade secrets, mostly regarding manufacturing processes and material compositions that give many of its businesses important advantages in their markets. The Company continues
to strive to improve those processes and generate new material compositions that provide additional benefits. The
Company also has a number of domestic and international registered trademarks that have significant recognition within the markets that are served. Examples include the name Alcoa and the Alcoa symbol for aluminum products, Howmet metal
castings, Huck ® fasteners, Kawneer ® building panels and
Dura-Bright ® wheels with easy-clean surface treatments. The Companys rights under its trademarks are
important to the Company as a whole and, to varying degrees, important to each business segment. Competitive Conditions Alcoa is subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of its aluminum and non-aluminum businesses. Competitors include a
variety of both U.S. and non-U.S. companies in all major markets. Price, quality, and service are the principal competitive factors in Alcoas markets. Where aluminum products compete with other materialssuch as steel and plastics for
automotive and building applications; magnesium, titanium, composites, and plastics for aerospace and defense applicationsaluminums diverse characteristics, particularly its strength, light weight, recyclability, and flexibility are also
significant factors. Alcoas technology, technical expertise, and innovation in multi-materials and in specialized alloys provide Alcoa a competitive advantage in certain markets and/or for certain 24 products. For Alcoas segments that market products under Alcoas brand names, brand recognition, and brand loyalty also play a role. In addition Alcoas competitive position
depends, in part, on the Companys access to an economical power supply to sustain its operations in various countries. Research
and Development Alcoa, a light metals technology leader, engages in research and development programs that include process and
product development, and basic and applied research. Expenditures for research and development (R&D) activities were $218 million in 2014, $192 million in 2013, and $197 million in 2012. During 2014, the Company continued to work on new developments for a number of strategic projects in all business segments. The Company also developed a portfolio of foundry alloys primarily for next
generation automotive engine and suspension applications. The Company continued its progress leveraging new science and
technologies in 2014. For example, a new, higher strength wheel alloy (MagnaForce  ) was developed for next
generation wheels, as was the development and deployment of a more corrosion resistant, more environmentally friendly Dura-Bright EVO  surface treatment. In addition, the Company launched in 2014 the Ultra ONE TM wheel, a commercial truck wheel using the MagnaForce TM alloy. In
the Global Rolled Products segment, the Company continued its progress leveraging new science and technologies in 2014. For example, the Company publicly disclosed the development of a high speed continuous casting and rolling technology for
aluminum sheet named the Micromill. This technology converts molten metal to a full coil in 20 minutes versus current typical times of 20 days for traditional ingot based processes. In addition, significant product attributes can be improved
through this process including higher strengths, formability and corrosion resistance. A number of products were
commercialized in 2014 including new fasteners, aluminum lithium (Al-Li), new brazing sheet alloys for stationary and automotive applications and more traditional 7xxx series alloys for various aerospace applications including the worlds
largest aluminum forming, which is the complete armored undercarriage of future transport vehicles termed the monolithic hull. The Company has also continued to externally license technology including the Alcoa 951 pretreatment
technology (an enabler for adhesive bonding of aluminum-intensive vehicles), shaping technology, and Colorkast  products for the consumer electronics market. Environmental Matters Information relating to environmental matters is included in Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption Environmental Matters on pages 125-128. Approved capital
expenditures for new or expanded facilities for environmental control are approximately $120 million for 2015 and $180 million for 2016. Employees Total worldwide
employment at the end of 2014 was approximately 59,000 employees in 30 countries. About 37,000 of these employees are represented by labor unions. The Company believes that relations with its employees and any applicable union representatives
generally are good. In the U.S., approximately 9,600 employees are represented by various labor unions. The largest of these is the master
collective bargaining agreement between Alcoa and the United Steelworkers (USW). On June 6, 2014, the USW ratified a new five-year labor agreement covering approximately 6,100 employees at 11 U.S. locations; the previous labor agreement expired
on May 15, 2014. There are 16 other collective bargaining agreements in the U.S. with varying expiration dates. On a regional basis, collective bargaining agreements with varying expiration dates cover approximately 15,500 employees in Europe
and Russia, 11,400 employees in North America, 5,600 employees in Central and South America, 3,500 employees in Australia, and 1,200 employees in China. 25 Executive Officers of the Registrant The names, ages, positions and areas of responsibility of the executive officers of the Company as of February 19, 2015 are listed below.

Alcoas business, financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by a number of factors. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following risks and
uncertainties could materially harm its business, financial condition or results of operations, including causing Alcoas actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. The following list of
significant risk factors is not all-inclusive or necessarily in order of importance. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Alcoa or that Alcoa currently deems immaterial also may materially adversely affect us in future periods. The aluminum industry and aluminum end-use markets are highly cyclical and are influenced by a number of factors, including global
economic conditions. The aluminum industry generally is highly cyclical, and Alcoa is subject to cyclical fluctuations in global economic
conditions and aluminum end-use markets. Alcoa sells many products to industries that are cyclical, such as the commercial construction and transportation industries, and the demand for its products is sensitive to, and quickly impacted by, demand
for the finished goods manufactured by its customers in these industries, which may change as a result of changes in the general U.S. or worldwide economy, currency exchange rates, energy prices or other factors beyond its control. The demand for
aluminum is highly correlated to economic growth. For example, the European sovereign debt crisis had an adverse effect on European supply and demand for aluminum and aluminum products. The Chinese market is a significant source of global demand for
commodities, including aluminum. A sustained slowdown in Chinas economic growth and aluminum demand that is not offset by increased aluminum demand in emerging economies, such as India, Brazil, and several South East Asian countries, or the
combined slowdown of other markets, could have an adverse effect on the global supply and demand for aluminum and aluminum prices. 27 While Alcoa believes that the long-term prospects for aluminum and aluminum products are positive, the
Company is unable to predict the future course of industry variables or the strength, pace or sustainability of the global economic recovery and the effects of government intervention. Negative economic conditions, such as another major economic
downturn, a prolonged recovery period, or disruptions in the financial markets, could have a material adverse effect on Alcoas business, financial condition or results of operations. Alcoa could be materially adversely affected by declines in aluminum prices, including global, regional and product-specific prices. The overall price of primary aluminum consists of several components: 1) the underlying base metal component, which is typically based on quoted prices from the London Metal Exchange (LME); 2) the
regional premium, which comprises the incremental price over the base LME component that is associated with the physical delivery of metal to a particular region (e.g., the Midwest premium for metal sold in the United States); and 3) the product
premium, which represents the incremental price for receiving physical metal in a particular shape (e.g., coil, billet, slab, rod, etc.) or alloy. Each of the above three components has its own drivers of variability. The LME price is typically
driven by macroeconomic factors, global supply and demand of aluminum (including expectations for growth and contraction and the level of global inventories), and financial investors. Regional premiums tend to vary based on the supply of and demand
for metal in a particular region and associated transportation costs. Product premiums generally are a function of supply and demand for a given primary aluminum shape and alloy combination in a particular region. Speculative trading in aluminum and
the influence of hedge funds and other financial institutions participating in commodity markets have also increased in recent years, contributing to higher levels of price volatility. In 2014, the LME price of aluminum reached a high of $2,089 per
metric ton and a low of $1,634 per metric ton. High LME inventories, or the release of substantial inventories into the market, could lead to a reduction in the price of aluminum. Declines in the LME price have had a negative impact on Alcoas
results of operations. Additionally, Alcoas results could be adversely affected by decreases in regional premiums that participants in the physical metal market pay for immediate delivery of aluminum. Although regional premiums have reached
levels substantially higher than historical averages during 2013 and 2014, new LME warehousing rules (see risk factor entitled New LME warehousing rules could cause aluminum prices to decrease.) or other factors may cause these premiums
to decrease, which would have a negative impact on the Companys results of operations. A sustained weak LME aluminum pricing environment, deterioration in LME aluminum prices, or a decrease in regional premiums or product premiums could have a
material adverse effect on Alcoas business, financial condition, and results of operations or cash flow. New LME warehousing rules
could cause aluminum prices to decrease. In 2013, the LME announced new rules scheduled to take effect on April 1, 2014 that would
require LME warehouses, under certain conditions, to deliver out more aluminum than they take in. Although a court in the United Kingdom ruled in March 2014 that the LMEs consultation process in developing the new rules had been unfair and
unlawful, in October 2014, a court of appeal in the United Kingdom upheld the LMEs consultation process as being fair. The new warehousing rules, which took effect on February 1, 2015, could cause an increase in the supply of aluminum to
enter the physical market and may cause regional delivery premiums, product premiums and LME aluminum prices to fall. Decreases in regional delivery and product premiums, decreases in LME aluminum prices and increases in the supply of aluminum could
have a material adverse effect on Alcoas business, financial condition, and results of operations or cash flow. Alcoa may not be
able to realize the expected benefits from its strategy of transforming its portfolio by growing its value-add business and by creating a lower cost, competitive commodity business by optimizing its portfolio. Alcoa is continuing to execute on its strategy of transforming its portfolio by growing its value-add business to capture profitable growth as a
lightweight metals innovation leader and by creating a lower cost, competitive commodity business by optimizing its portfolio. It is investing in its value-add manufacturing and engineering businesses to capture growth opportunities in strong end
markets like automotive and aerospace. Alcoa is also building out its value-add businesses, including by introducing innovative new products and technology solutions, and investing in 28 expansions of value-add capacity. Alcoas growth projects include the joint venture with Maaden in Saudi Arabia; the automotive expansions in Davenport, Iowa and Alcoa, Tennessee; the
aluminum lithium capacity expansion in Lafayette, Indiana, at the Alcoa Technical Center in Pennsylvania and at the Kitts Green plant in the United Kingdom; and the expansion in aerospace capabilities in La Porte, Indiana, Hampton, Virginia and
Davenport, Iowa. From time to time, Alcoa also pursues growth opportunities that are strategically aligned with its objectives, such as the acquisition of the Firth Rixson business (completed in November 2014) and the announced acquisition of TITAL
(expected to close in the first quarter of 2015). In addition, Alcoa is optimizing its rolling mill portfolio as part of its strategy for profitable growth in the midstream business. At the same time, the Company is creating a competitive commodity
business by taking decisive actions to lower the cost base of its upstream operations, closing, selling or curtailing high-cost global smelting capacity, optimizing alumina refining capacity, and pursuing the sale of its interest in certain other
operations. Alcoa has made, and may continue to plan and execute, acquisitions and divestitures and take other actions to grow or streamline
its portfolio. Although management believes that its strategic actions will be beneficial to Alcoa, there is no assurance that anticipated benefits will be realized. Adverse factors may prevent Alcoa from realizing the benefits of its growth
projects, including unfavorable global economic conditions, currency fluctuations, or unexpected delays in target timelines. Acquisitions present significant challenges and risks, including the effective integration of the business into the Company
and unanticipated costs and liabilities, and the Company may be unable to manage acquisitions successfully. Alcoa may face barriers to exit from unprofitable businesses or operations, including high exit costs or objections from various
stakeholders. In addition, Alcoa may retain unforeseen liabilities for divested entities if the buyer fails to honor all commitments. There can be no assurance that acquisitions and divestitures will be undertaken or completed in their entirety as
planned or that they will be beneficial to Alcoa. Market-driven balancing of global aluminum supply and demand may be disrupted by
non-market forces or other impediments to production closures. In response to market-driven factors relating to the global supply and
demand of aluminum, Alcoa has curtailed portions of its aluminum production. Certain other aluminum producers have independently undertaken to make cuts in production as well. However, the existence of non-market forces on global aluminum industry
capacity, such as political pressures in certain countries to keep jobs or to maintain or further develop industry self-sufficiency, may prevent or delay the closure or curtailment of certain producers smelters, irrespective of their position
on the industry cost curve. Other production cuts may be impeded by long-term contracts to buy power or raw materials. If industry overcapacity persists due to the disruption by such non-market forces on the market-driven balancing of the global
supply and demand of aluminum, the resulting weak pricing environment and margin compression may adversely affect the operating results of aluminum producers, including Alcoa. Alcoas operations consume substantial amounts of energy; profitability may decline if energy costs rise or if energy supplies are interrupted. Alcoas operations consume substantial amounts of energy. Although Alcoa generally expects to meet the energy requirements for its alumina
refineries and primary aluminum smelters from internal sources or from long-term contracts, certain conditions could negatively affect Alcoas results of operations, including the following:  significant increases in electricity costs rendering smelter operations uneconomic;  significant increases in fuel oil or natural gas prices;  unavailability of electrical power or other energy sources due to droughts, hurricanes or other natural causes;  unavailability of energy due to energy shortages resulting in insufficient supplies to serve consumers;  interruptions in energy supply or unplanned outages due to equipment failure or other causes;  curtailment of one or more refineries or smelters due to the inability to extend energy contracts upon expiration or to negotiate new arrangements on
cost-effective terms or due to the unavailability of energy at competitive rates; or 29  curtailment of one or more smelters due to a regulatory authoritys determination that power supply interruptibility rights granted to Alcoa under
an interruptibility regime in place under the laws of the country in which the smelter is located do not comply with the regulatory authoritys state aid rules, thus rendering the smelter operations that had been relying on such countrys
interruptibility regime uneconomic. If events such as those listed above were to occur, the resulting high energy costs or
the disruption of an energy source or the requirement to repay all or a portion of the benefit Alcoa received under a power supply interruptibility regime could have a material adverse effect on Alcoas business and results of operations. Alcoas profitability could be adversely affected by increases in the cost of raw materials or by significant lag effects of
decreases in commodity or LME-linked costs. Alcoas results of operations are affected by changes in the cost of raw materials,
including energy, carbon products, caustic soda and other key inputs, as well as freight costs associated with transportation of raw materials to refining and smelting locations. Alcoa may not be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw
material costs or energy costs through price increases, productivity improvements or cost reduction programs. Similarly, Alcoas operating results are affected by significant lag effects of declines in key costs of production that are commodity
or LME-linked. For example, declines in the LME-linked costs of alumina and power during a particular period may not be adequate to offset sharp declines in metal price in that period. Increases in the cost of raw materials or decreases in input
costs that are disproportionate to concurrent sharper decreases in the price of aluminum could have a material adverse effect on Alcoas operating results. Alcoa is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, as well as inflation, and other economic factors in the countries in which it operates. Economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, competitive factors in the countries in
which Alcoa operates, and continued volatility or deterioration in the global economic and financial environment could affect Alcoas revenues, expenses and results of operations. Changes in the valuation of the U.S. dollar against other
currencies, particularly the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, Canadian dollar, Euro and Norwegian kroner, may affect Alcoas profitability as some important inputs are purchased in other currencies, while the Companys upstream products
are generally sold in U.S. dollars. In addition, although a strong U.S. dollar helps Alcoas near-term profitability, over a longer term, a strong U.S. dollar may have an unfavorable impact to Alcoas position on the global aluminum cost
curve due to Alcoas U.S. smelting portfolio. As the U.S. dollar strengthens, the cost curve shifts down for smelters outside the U.S. but costs for Alcoas U.S. smelting portfolio may not decline. Alcoa may not be able to successfully realize goals established in each of its four business segments, at the levels or by the dates targeted for such
goals. Alcoa established targets for each of its four major business segments, including the following:  by 2016, driving the alumina business further down the industry cost curve into the 21st percentile;  by 2016, driving the aluminum business further down the industry cost curve into the 38th percentile;  by 2016, increasing the revenues of the Global Rolled Products segment, while improving margins that meet or exceed average historical levels, by $1.0
billion, with 90% expected to be generated from innovation and share gains; and  by 2016, increasing the revenues of the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, while improving margins that exceed historical levels, by $1.2
billion, with 75% expected to be generated from innovation and share gains. 30 For more information regarding Alcoas targets, see Management Review of 2014 and Outlook for the
Future in Part II, Item 7. (Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) of this report. There can be no assurance that any of these targets or other goals will be completed as
anticipated. Market conditions or other factors may prevent Alcoa from accomplishing its goals at the levels or by the dates targeted, if at all, and failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results
of operations or the market price of its securities. Alcoa faces significant competition, which may have an adverse effect on
profitability. As discussed in Part I, Item 1. (BusinessCompetitive Conditions) of this report, the markets for Alcoas
aluminum and non-aluminum products are highly competitive. Alcoas competitors include a variety of both U.S. and non-U.S. companies in all major markets, including some that are subsidized. In addition, aluminum competes with other materials,
such as steel, plastics, composites, ceramics, and glass, among others, for various applications in Alcoas key markets. New product offerings or new technologies in the marketplace may compete with or replace Alcoa products. The willingness of
customers to accept substitutes for the products sold by Alcoa, the ability of large customers to exert leverage in the marketplace to affect the pricing for fabricated aluminum products, and technological advancements or other developments by or
affecting Alcoas competitors or customers could affect Alcoas results of operations. In addition, Alcoas competitive position depends, in part, on the Companys ability to leverage its innovation expertise across its
businesses and key end markets and, in the case of its upstream businesses, having access to an economical power supply to sustain its operations in various countries. A downgrade of Alcoas credit ratings could limit Alcoas ability to obtain future financing, increase its borrowing costs, increase the pricing of its credit facilities, adversely affect the
market price of its securities, trigger letter of credit or other collateral postings, or otherwise impair its business, financial condition, and results of operations. Standard and Poors Ratings Services currently rates Alcoas long-term debt BBB-, the lowest level of investment grade rating, with a negative ratings outlook (ratings and outlook were affirmed
on April 23, 2014). In May 2013, Moodys Investors Service downgraded Alcoas long-term debt rating from Baa3 to Ba1, which is below investment grade, and changed the outlook from rating under review to stable. In April 2014, Fitch
Ratings downgraded Alcoas rating from BBB- to BB+, a below investment grade rating, and changed the outlook from negative to stable. There can be no assurance that one or more of these or other rating agencies will not take further negative
actions with respect to Alcoas ratings. Increased debt levels, adverse aluminum market or macroeconomic conditions, a deterioration in the Companys debt protection metrics, a contraction in the Companys liquidity, or other factors
could potentially trigger such actions. A rating agency may lower, suspend or withdraw entirely a rating or place it on negative outlook or watch if, in that rating agencys judgment, circumstances so warrant. As a result of the Moodys downgrade, certain counterparties have required Alcoa to post letters of credit or cash collateral, and the cost of
issuance of new public debt and commercial paper has increased. For more information regarding the effects of the Moodys downgrade on the Companys liquidity, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Financing Activities in this report. The Company does not believe that Alcoas financing activities were significantly impacted by the Fitch downgrade. However, any
further downgrade of Alcoas credit ratings by one or more rating agencies could adversely impact the market price of Alcoas securities, adversely affect existing financing (for example, a downgrade by Standard and Poors or a
further downgrade by Moodys would subject Alcoa to higher costs under Alcoas Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement and certain of its other revolving credit facilities), limit access to the capital (including commercial paper) or credit
markets or otherwise adversely affect the availability of other new financing on favorable terms, if at all, result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that the Company incurs, increase the cost
of borrowing or fees on undrawn credit facilities, result in vendors or counterparties seeking collateral or letters of credit from Alcoa, or otherwise impair Alcoas business, financial condition and results of operations. 31 Cyber attacks and security breaches may threaten the integrity of Alcoas intellectual property and
other sensitive information, disrupt its business operations, and result in reputational harm and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operation. Alcoa faces global cybersecurity threats, which may range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures, known as
advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company. Cyber attacks and security breaches may include, but are not limited to, attempts to access information, computer viruses, denial of service and other electronic security breaches. The Company believes that it faces a heightened threat of cyber attacks due to the industries it serves, the locations of its operations and its
technological innovations. The Company has experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past, including breaches of its information technology systems in which information was taken, and may experience them in the future, potentially with more frequency
or sophistication. Based on information known to date, past attacks have not had a material impact on Alcoas financial condition or results of operations. However, due to the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats, the scope and impact of
any future incident cannot be predicted. While the Company continually works to safeguard its systems and mitigate potential risks, there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyber attacks or security breaches that
manipulate or improperly use its systems or networks, compromise confidential or otherwise protected information, destroy or corrupt data, or otherwise disrupt its operations. The occurrence of such events could negatively impact Alcoas
reputation and its competitive position and could result in litigation with third parties, regulatory action, loss of business, potential liability and increased remediation costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its financial
condition and results of operations. In addition, such attacks or breaches could require significant management attention and resources, and result in the diminution of the value of the Companys investment in research and development. Joint ventures and other strategic alliances may not be successful. Alcoa participates in joint ventures and has formed strategic alliances and may enter into other similar arrangements in the future. For example, in December 2009, Alcoa formed a joint venture with
Maaden, the Saudi Arabian Mining Company, to develop a fully integrated aluminum complex (including a bauxite mine, alumina refinery, aluminum smelter and rolling mill) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Although the Company has, in connection
with the Saudi Arabia joint venture and its other existing joint ventures and strategic alliances, sought to protect its interests, joint ventures and strategic alliances inherently involve special risks. Whether or not Alcoa holds majority
interests or maintains operational control in such arrangements, its partners may:  have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with or opposed to those of the Company;  exercise veto rights so as to block actions that Alcoa believes to be in its or the joint ventures or strategic alliances best interests;  take action contrary to Alcoas policies or objectives with respect to its investments; or  as a result of financial or other difficulties, be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under the joint venture, strategic alliance or
other agreements, such as contributing capital to expansion or maintenance projects. There can be no assurance that
Alcoas joint ventures or strategic alliances will be beneficial to Alcoa, whether due to the above-described risks, unfavorable global economic conditions, increases in construction costs, currency fluctuations, political risks, or other
factors. Alcoas business and growth prospects may be negatively impacted by limits in its capital expenditures. Alcoa requires substantial capital to invest in growth opportunities and to maintain and prolong the life and capacity of its existing facilities. For
2015, generating positive cash flow from operations that will exceed capital spending continues to be an Alcoa target. Insufficient cash generation or capital project overruns may negatively impact Alcoas 32 ability to fund as planned its sustaining and return-seeking capital projects. Over the long term, Alcoas ability to take advantage of improved aluminum or other market conditions or growth
opportunities in its midstream and downstream businesses may be constrained by earlier capital expenditure restrictions, which could adversely affect the long-term value of its business and the Companys position in relation to its competitors. Alcoa may also need to address commercial and political issues in relation to its reductions in capital expenditures in certain of the
jurisdictions in which it operates. If Alcoas interest in its joint ventures is diluted or it loses key concessions, its growth could be constrained. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business,
results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Alcoas global operations expose the Company to risks that could adversely
affect Alcoas business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows. Alcoa has operations or activities in numerous
countries and regions outside the United States, including Brazil, China, Europe, Guinea, Russia, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Companys global operations are subject to a number of risks, including:  economic and commercial instability risks, including those caused by sovereign and private debt default, corruption, and changes in local government
laws, regulations and policies, such as those related to tariffs and trade barriers, taxation, exchange controls, employment regulations and repatriation of earnings;  geopolitical risks such as political instability, civil unrest, expropriation, nationalization of properties by a government, imposition of sanctions,
renegotiation or nullification of existing agreements, mining leases and permits;  war or terrorist activities;  major public health issues such as an outbreak of a pandemic or epidemic (such as Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Avian Influenza, H7N9 virus, or
the Ebola virus), which could cause disruptions in Alcoas operations or workforce;  difficulties enforcing intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions; and  unexpected events, including fires or explosions at facilities, and natural disasters. While the impact of any of the foregoing factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect Alcoas business, financial
condition, operating results or cash flows. Existing insurance arrangements may not provide protection for the costs that may arise from such events. An adverse decline in the liability discount rate, lower-than-expected investment return on pension assets and other factors could affect Alcoas results of operations or amount of pension funding
contributions in future periods. Alcoas results of operations may be negatively affected by the amount of expense Alcoa records for
its pension and other postretirement benefit plans, reductions in the fair value of plan assets and other factors. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) require that Alcoa calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial
valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions about financial market and other economic conditions, which may change based on changes in
key economic indicators. The most significant year-end assumptions used by Alcoa to estimate pension or other postretirement benefit income or expense for the following year are the discount rate applied to plan liabilities and the expected
long-term rate of return on plan assets. In addition, Alcoa is required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in a significant charge to shareholders equity. For a discussion regarding how Alcoas
financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement benefits accounting policies, see Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesPension and Other Postretirement Benefits in Part II, Item 7.
(Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) and Note W to the 33 Consolidated Financial StatementsPension and Other Postretirement Benefits in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data). Although GAAP expense and pension funding
contributions are impacted by different regulations and requirements, the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or securities Alcoa would contribute to the pension plans. Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law and discretionary contributions to improve the plans
funded status. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21), enacted in 2012, provided temporary relief for employers like Alcoa who sponsor defined benefit pension plans related
to funding contributions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 by allowing the use of a 25-year average discount rate within an upper and lower range for purposes of determining minimum funding obligations. On August 8,
2014, the Highway and Transportation Funding Act (HATFA) was signed into law. HATFA extended the relief provided by MAP-21 and modified the interest rates that had been set by MAP-21. Alcoa believes that the relief provided by HATFA will moderately
reduce the cash flow sensitivity of the Companys U.S. pension plans funded status to potential declines in discount rates over the next several years. However, higher than expected pension contributions due to a decline in the
plans funded status as a result of declines in the discount rate or lower-than-expected investment returns on plan assets could have a material negative effect on the Companys cash flows. Adverse capital market conditions could result in
reductions in the fair value of plan assets and increase the Companys liabilities related to such plans, adversely affecting Alcoas liquidity and results of operations. Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect Alcoas future profitability. Alcoa is subject to income taxes in both the United States and various non-U.S. jurisdictions. Its domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these
different jurisdictions. Changes in applicable domestic or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including the possibility of retroactive effect, could affect the Companys tax expense and profitability.
Alcoas tax expense includes estimates of additional tax that may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions. The assumptions include assessments of future earnings of the Company that could impact the
valuation of its deferred tax assets. The Companys future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates,
changes in the overall profitability of the Company, changes in tax legislation and rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the results of tax audits and
examinations of previously filed tax returns or related litigation and continuing assessments of its tax exposures. Corporate tax reform and tax law changes continue to be analyzed in the United States and in many other jurisdictions. Significant
changes to the U.S. corporate tax system in particular could have a substantial impact, positive or negative, on Alcoas effective tax rate, cash tax expenditures, and deferred tax assets and liabilities. Union disputes and other employee relations issues could adversely affect Alcoas financial results. A significant portion of Alcoas employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements
with varying durations and expiration dates. For more information, see Employees in Part I, Item 1. (Business) of this report. While Alcoa was previously successful in renegotiating the master collective bargaining agreement with
the United Steelworkers (the most recent renegotiation having taken place in June 2014), Alcoa may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate that agreement or other collective bargaining agreements in the U.S. and other countries when they expire.
In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at Alcoas facilities in the future. Alcoa may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to its business or collective
bargaining agreements. Any such work stoppages (or potential work stoppages) could have a material adverse effect on Alcoas financial results. 34 Alcoa could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition of a significant
customer or customers. A significant downturn or deterioration in the business or financial condition of a key customer or customers
supplied by Alcoa could affect Alcoas results of operations in a particular period. Alcoas customers may experience delays in the launch of new products, labor strikes, diminished liquidity or credit unavailability, weak demand for their
products, or other difficulties in their businesses. If Alcoa is not successful in replacing business lost from such customers, profitability may be adversely affected. Alcoa may not be able to successfully develop and implement technology initiatives. Alcoa
is working on new developments for a number of strategic projects in all business segments, including advanced smelting process technologies such as inert anode and carbothermic technology, alloy development, engineered finishes and product design,
high speed continuous casting and rolling technology, and other advanced manufacturing technologies. For more information on Alcoas research and development programs, see Research and Development in Part I, Item 1. (Business)
of this report. There can be no assurance that such developments or technologies will be commercially feasible or beneficial to Alcoa. Alcoas human resource talent pool may not be adequate to support the Companys growth. Alcoas existing operations and development projects require highly skilled executives and staff with relevant industry and technical experience.
The inability of the Company or the industry to attract and retain such people may adversely impact Alcoas ability to adequately meet project demands and fill roles in existing operations. Skills shortages in engineering, technical service,
construction and maintenance contractors and other labor market inadequacies may also impact activities. These shortages may adversely impact the cost and schedule of development projects and the cost and efficiency of existing operations. Alcoa may not realize expected benefits from its productivity and cost-reduction initiatives. Alcoa has undertaken, and may continue to undertake, productivity and cost-reduction initiatives to improve performance and conserve cash, including new
procurement strategies for raw materials, such as backward integration and non-traditional sourcing from numerous geographies, deployment of company-wide business process models, such as Alcoas degrees of implementation process in which ideas
are executed in a disciplined manner to generate savings, and overhead cost reductions. There is no assurance that these initiatives will be successful or beneficial to Alcoa or that estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized. Alcoa may be exposed to significant legal proceedings, investigations or changes in U.S. federal, state or foreign law, regulation or
policy. Alcoas results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by new or increasingly stringent laws,
regulatory requirements or interpretations, or outcomes of significant legal proceedings or investigations adverse to Alcoa. The Company may experience a change in effective tax rates or become subject to unexpected or rising costs associated with
business operations or provision of health or welfare benefits to employees due to changes in laws, regulations or policies. The Company is also subject to a variety of legal compliance risks. These risks include, among other things, potential
claims relating to product liability, health and safety, environmental matters, intellectual property rights, government contracts, taxes, and compliance with U.S. and foreign export laws, anti-bribery laws, competition laws and sales and trading
practices. Alcoa could be subject to fines, penalties, damages (in certain cases, treble damages), or suspension or debarment from government contracts. While Alcoa believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to address and reduce these risks, the global and diverse nature of its operations means that these risks will
continue to exist, and additional legal proceedings and contingencies may arise from time to time. In addition, various factors or developments can lead 35 the Company to change current estimates of liabilities or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a
significant settlement, significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling or settlement or unfavorable changes in laws, regulations or policies, or other contingencies that the Company cannot predict with
certainty could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. For additional information regarding the legal proceedings involving the Company, see the discussion in Part I,
Item 3. (Legal Proceedings) of this report and in Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data). Alcoa is subject to a broad range of health, safety and environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may be exposed to substantial costs and liabilities associated
with such laws and regulations. Alcoas operations worldwide are subject to numerous complex and increasingly stringent health,
safety and environmental laws and regulations. The costs of complying with such laws and regulations, including participation in assessments and cleanups of sites, as well as internal voluntary programs, are significant and will continue to be so
for the foreseeable future. Environmental laws may impose cleanup liability on owners and occupiers of contaminated property, including past or divested properties, regardless of whether the owners and occupiers caused the contamination or whether
the activity that caused the contamination was lawful at the time it was conducted. Environmental matters for which Alcoa may be liable may arise in the future at its present sites, where no problem is currently known, at previously owned sites,
sites previously operated by the Company, sites owned by its predecessors or sites that it may acquire in the future. Compliance with environmental, health and safety legislation and regulatory requirements may prove to be more limiting and costly
than the Company anticipates. Alcoas results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by certain health, safety or environmental matters, including remediation costs and damages related to certain sites.
Additionally, evolving regulatory standards and expectations can result in increased litigation and/or increased costs, all of which can have a material and adverse effect on earnings and cash flows. Climate change, climate change legislation or regulations and greenhouse effects may adversely impact Alcoas operations and markets. Energy is a significant input in a number of Alcoas operations. There is growing recognition that consumption of energy derived
from fossil fuels is a contributor to global warming. A number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating
legislative and regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change. There is also current and emerging regulation, such as the mandatory renewable energy target in Australia, Québecs transition to a cap and
trade system with compliance required beginning 2013, the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme and the United States clean power plan for existing power plants, proposed on June 18, 2014. Alcoa will likely see changes in the
margins of greenhouse gas-intensive assets and energy-intensive assets as a result of regulatory impacts in the countries in which the Company operates. These regulatory mechanisms may be either voluntary or legislated and may impact Alcoas
operations directly or indirectly through customers or Alcoas supply chain. Inconsistency of regulations may also change the attractiveness of the locations of some of the Companys assets. Assessments of the potential impact of future
climate change legislation, regulation and international treaties and accords are uncertain, given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in countries in which Alcoa operates. The Company may realize increased capital expenditures resulting
from required compliance with revised or new legislation or regulations, costs to purchase or profits from sales of, allowances or credits under a cap and trade system, increased insurance premiums and deductibles as new actuarial tables
are developed to reshape coverage, a change in competitive position relative to industry peers and changes to profit or loss arising from increased or decreased demand for goods produced by the Company and indirectly, from changes in costs of goods
sold. The potential physical impacts of climate change on the Companys operations are highly uncertain, and will be particular to the
geographic circumstances. These may include changes in rainfall patterns, shortages of water or other 36 natural resources, changing sea levels, changing storm patterns and intensities, and changing temperature levels. These effects may adversely impact the cost, production and financial performance
of Alcoas operations.
