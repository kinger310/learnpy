Form 10-K Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. We have provided a reconciliation below of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. We
have included Adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core
operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short- and long-term operational plans. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating
Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in
understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Our
use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some
of these limitations are:  although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the
future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;  Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;  Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation;  Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest or tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and  other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a
comparative measure. Because
of these and other limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other GAAP-based financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net income
(loss) and our other GAAP results. The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA (loss) to net loss for each of the periods indicated: Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 2011 (in thousands) Net loss $ (28,999 ) $ (27,953 ) $ (23,113 ) $ (24,878 ) Adjustments: Interest expense 1,213 (27 ) 73 19 Interest income (92 ) (26 ) (38 ) (45 ) Depreciation and amortization expense 5,572 4,335 2,869 1,551 Stock-based compensation expense 7,527 2,426 1,395 839 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total adjustments 14,220 6,708 4,299 2,364 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Adjusted EBITDA (loss) $ (14,779 ) $ (21,245 ) $ (18,814 ) $ (22,514 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 47 Table of Contents Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in
conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information
contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that
involve risks and uncertainties. You should review Item 1A. "Risk Factors" and "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" in this report for a discussion of important factors that
could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. Overview We are a leading provider of an integrated solution comprised of cloud-based software-as-a-service, or SaaS, technology fused with
technology-enabled services, which we refer to as our Platform. Our Platform enables leading nonprofit colleges and universities to deliver their high quality education to qualified students anywhere.
Our SaaS technology consists of an innovative online learning environment, which we refer to as Online Campus, and our operations applications. This technology is fused with technology-enabled
services, to complete our Platform. Our Platform allows our clients' programs to expand and operate at scale, providing the comprehensive infrastructure colleges and universities need to attract,
enroll, educate, support and graduate their students. By leveraging our Platform, we believe our clients are able to expand their addressable markets while providing educational engagement,
experiences and outcomes to their online students that match or exceed those of their on-campus offerings. Our
clients use the Online Campus portion of our Platform to offer high quality educational content, instructor-led classes averaging ten students per session in a live, intimate and
engaging setting, and a rich social networking experience, all accessible through proprietary web-based and mobile applications. Online Campus challenges every student to learn from the front row and
every faculty member to engage students in new and innovative ways. Our clients use the operations applications within our Platform to expand, enable and support their online operations, and integrate
those operations with their existing university systems. These applications provide the content management, admissions application processing, customer relationship management, and other functionality
necessary to effectively operate our clients' programs. Our Platform also provides clients with real-time data and deep analytical insight related to student performance and engagement, student and
faculty satisfaction, and enrollment. We believe that the SaaS technology within our Platform is flexible, easy to use, highly scalable and characterized by a high level of availability and security. The
technology-enabled services we provide within our Platform are designed to improve enrollment and retention of our clients' students as well as to provide those students with a
complete, high quality educational experience. We have primary responsibility for identifying qualified students for our clients' programs, generating potential student interest in the programs and
driving applications to the programs. We have developed sophisticated digital program marketing and student acquisition capabilities, and we work closely with our clients to help them create highly
engaging multimedia instructional content for delivery through Online Campus. We also provide other services that support the complete lifecycle of a higher education program, including advising
prospective students through the admissions application process, providing technical, success coaching and other support, facilitating accessibility to individuals with disabilities, and facilitating
in-program field placements. We provide the significant domain expertise and operating capacity our clients require to scale and operate successfully in the online environment. 48 Table of Contents Our
clients use our Platform to offer full graduate degree programs online, and some offer doctorate and undergraduate degree programs as well. The students in these programs receive the
same degree or credit as their on-campus counterparts, and generally pay equivalent tuition. We are currently engaged by 11 well-recognized colleges and universities to enable 15 programs that have
launched and in which students have enrolled. The first of our clients' programs was launched in 2009. One additional program launched in 2010 with two more commencing in 2011. In 2013, our clients
launched five new programs. An additional four programs launched in 2014, and a dual degree between an additional university client and one of our existing clients also launched in 2014. In 2015, our
clients launched two programs and we have announced three new graduate programs with two current university clients and one new university client that we expect to launch later in 2015. Most of our
client contracts have initial terms between 10 and 15 years in length, though one is longer, and, since our inception, all of the clients that have engaged us remain active. A
significant percentage of our annual revenue is related to students returning to our clients' programs after their first semester. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2014,
62% of our revenue was related to students who had enrolled and completed their first semester prior to the start of the year. We believe this high percentage of revenue attributable to returning
students contributes to the predictability and recurring nature of our business. We
have achieved significant growth in a relatively short period of time. Full course equivalent enrollments in our clients' programs grew from 14,099 during the twelve months ended
December 31, 2011 to 41,034 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, representing a compound annual growth rate of 43%. From our inception through December 31, 2014, more
than 12,300 unique individuals have enrolled as students in our clients' programs. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, our revenue was $110.2 million,
$83.1 million and $55.9 million, respectively. However, because we must incur significant technology, content development, program marketing and sales expenses well in advance of
generating revenues under a new client program, we have a history of losses despite our revenue growth. In order to become profitable, our revenues from existing client programs will need to increase
at a rate faster than the expenses we will incur in connection with the launch of new client programs. We
believe our business strategy will continue to offer significant opportunities for growth, but it also presents a number of risks and challenges. In particular, to remain competitive,
we will need to continue to innovate in a rapidly changing landscape for the application of technology like ours to the delivery of higher education. As described above, we have added, and we intend
to continue to add, degree programs in a number of new academic disciplines each year, as well as to expand the delivery of existing degree programs to new clients and to add new offerings to current
programs. To do so, we will need to convince new clients as to the quality and value of our Platform, cost-effectively identify qualified students for our clients' programs and help our clients retain
those students once enrolled. We must also be able to successfully execute our business strategy while navigating constantly changing
higher education laws and regulations applicable to our clients and, in some cases to ourselves, particularly the incentive compensation rule that generally prohibits making incentive payments related
to student acquisition. We seek to ensure that addressing all of these risks and challenges does not divert our management's attention from continuing to build on the strengths that we believe have
driven the growth of our business over the last several years. We believe our focus on delivering a differentiated Platform, maintaining the integrity of our clients' educational brands and enabling
strong student outcomes will contribute to the success of our business. However, we may not be successful in addressing and managing the many challenges and risks that we face. Our Business Model The key elements of our business model are described below. 49 Table of Contents Revenue Drivers Substantially all of our revenue is derived from revenue-share arrangements with our clients under which we receive a contractually
specified percentage of the amounts students pay them in tuition and other fees. Accordingly, the primary driver of our revenue growth is the number of student course enrollments in our clients'
programs. This in turn is influenced primarily by three factors:  our ability to increase the number of programs offered by our clients, either by adding new clients or by expanding the number of
client programs;  our ability to identify and acquire prospective students for our clients' programs; and  our ability, and that of our clients, to retain the students who enroll in their programs. In
the near term, we expect the primary drivers of our financial results to continue to be our two programs with the University of Southern California, which are our longest running
programs, launched in 2009 and 2010. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, 55%, 69% and 78%, respectively, of our revenue was derived from these two programs. We expect the
University of Southern California will continue to account for a large portion of our revenue until our other client programs become more mature and achieve significantly higher enrollment levels. Program Marketing and Sales Expense Our most significant expense in each fiscal period has been program marketing and sales expense, which relates primarily to student
acquisition activities. We do not spend significant amounts on new client or program acquisition and we do not maintain a sales force targeted at potential new clients or programs since our model is
not dependent on launching a large number of new programs per year, either with new or existing clients. Instead, our new clients and programs are largely generated through a direct approach by our
senior management to selected colleges and universities. We
have primary responsibility for identifying qualified students for our clients' programs, generating potential student interest in the programs and driving applications to the
programs. While our clients make all admissions decisions, the number of students who enroll in our clients' programs in any given period is significantly dependent on the amount we have spent on
these student acquisition activities in prior periods. Accordingly, although most of our clients' programs span multiple semesters and, therefore, generate continued revenue beyond the term in which
initial enrollments occur, we expect that we will need to continue to incur significant program marketing and sales expense for existing programs going forward to generate a continuous pipeline of new
enrollments. For new programs, we begin incurring program marketing and sales costs as early as nine months prior to the start of a new client program. We
typically identify prospective students for our clients' programs between three months and two or more years before they ultimately enroll. For the students currently enrolled in our
clients' programs
and those who have graduated, the average time from our initial prospective student acquisition to initial enrollment was seven months. For the students who have graduated from these programs, the
average time from initial enrollment to graduation was 21 months. However, because our clients' programs are relatively new, they have only graduated a limited number of students to date, with
many early enrollees still enrolled. Based on the student retention rates and patterns we have observed in our clients' programs, we estimate that, for our current programs, the average time from a
student's initial enrollment to graduation will be approximately 2.5 years. Accordingly,
our program marketing and sales expense in any period is an investment we make to generate revenue in future periods. Likewise, revenue generated in any period is largely
attributable to the investment made in student acquisition activities in earlier periods. Because program marketing and sales expense in any period is almost entirely unrelated to revenue generated in
that period, we do not 50 Table of Contents believe
it is meaningful to directly compare the two. We believe that the total revenue we will receive in the future from students who enroll in our clients' programs as a result of current period
program marketing and sales expense will be significantly greater as a multiple of that expense than is implied by the multiple of current period revenue to current period program marketing and sales
expense. Further, we believe that our program marketing and sales expense in future periods will generally decline as a percentage of the revenue reported in those same periods as our revenue base
from returning students in existing programs increases. We
continually manage our program marketing and sales expense to ensure that across our portfolio of client programs, our cost to acquire students for these programs is appropriate for
our business model. We use a ratio of attrition adjusted lifetime revenue of a student, or LTR, to the total cost to acquire that student, or TCA, as the measure of our marketing efficiency and to
determine how much we are willing to spend to acquire an additional student for any program. The calculations included in this ratio include certain assumptions. For any period, we know what we spent
on program sales and marketing and therefore, can accurately calculate the ratio's denominator. However, given the time lag between when we incur our program marketing and sales expense and when we
receive revenue related to students enrolled based on that expense, we have to incorporate forecasts of student enrollments and retention into our calculation of the ratio's numerator, which is our
estimate of future revenue related to that period's expense. We use the significant amount of data we have on the effectiveness of various marketing channels, student attrition and other factors to
inform our forecasts and are continually testing the assumptions underlying these forecasts against actual results to give us confidence that our forecasts are reasonable. The LTR to TCA ratio may
vary from program to program depending on the degree being offered, where that program is in its lifecycle and whether we enable the same or similar degrees at other universities. Period-to-Period Fluctuations Our revenue, cash position, accounts receivable and deferred revenue can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to
variations driven by the academic schedules of our clients' programs. These programs generally start classes for new and returning students an average of four times per year. Class starts are not
necessarily evenly spaced throughout the year, do not necessarily correspond to the traditional academic calendar and may vary from year to year. As a result, the number of classes our client programs
have in session, and therefore the number of students enrolled, will vary from month to month and quarter to quarter, leading to variability in our revenue. The
semesters of our clients' programs often straddle two fiscal quarters. Our clients generally pay us when they have billed tuition and specified fees to their students, which is
typically early in the semester, and once the drop/add period has passed. We recognize the related revenue ratably over the course of the semester. Because we generally receive payments from our
clients prior to our ability to recognize the majority of those amounts as revenue, we record deferred revenue at each balance sheet date equal to the excess of the amounts we have billed or received
from our clients over the amounts we have recognized as revenue as of that date. For these reasons, our cash flows typically vary considerably from quarter to quarter and our cash position, accounts
receivable and deferred revenue typically fluctuate between quarterly balance sheet dates. Our
expense levels also fluctuate from quarter to quarter, driven primarily by our program marketing and sales activity. We typically reduce our paid search and other program marketing
and sales efforts during late November and December because these efforts are less productive during the holiday season. This generally results in lower total program marketing and sales expense
during the fourth quarter. In addition, because we begin spending on technology and content development, program marketing and sales, and, to a lesser extent, services and support as much as nine
months prior to the start of classes for a new client program, these costs as a percentage of revenue fluctuate, 51 Table of Contents sometimes
significantly, depending on the timing of new client programs and anticipated program launch dates. Key Business and Financial Performance Metrics We use a number of key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate
financial projections and make strategic decisions. In addition to adjusted EBITDA, which we discuss below, we discuss revenue and the components of operating loss in the section below entitled
"Components of Operating Results." Additionally, we utilize other key metrics to evaluate the success of our growth strategy, including measures we refer to as Platform revenue retention
rate and full course equivalent enrollments in our clients' programs. Platform Revenue Retention Rate We measure our Platform revenue retention rate for a particular period by first identifying the group of programs that our clients
launched before the beginning of the prior year comparative period. We then calculate our Platform revenue retention rate by comparing the revenue we recognized for this group of programs in the
reporting period to the revenue we recognized for the same group of programs in the prior year comparative period, expressed as a percentage of the revenue we recognized for the group in the prior
year comparative period. The
following table sets forth our Platform revenue retention rate for the periods presented, as well as the number of programs included in the Platform revenue retention rate
calculation. For all of these periods, our Platform revenue retention rate was greater than 100% because we had no programs terminate and full course equivalent enrollments in the aggregate increased
year-over-year. There is no correlation between the Platform revenue retention rate and the number of programs included in the calculation of that rate. The number of programs may increase while the
retention rate declines. Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 (in thousands) Platform revenue retention rate 112.4 % 144.4 % 157.0 % Number of programs included in comparison(1) 4 4 2 (1) Reflects
the number of programs operating both in the reported period and in the prior year comparative period. Full Course Equivalent Enrollments in Our Clients' Programs We measure full course equivalent enrollments in our clients' programs by determining, for each of the courses offered during a
particular period, the number of students enrolled in that course multiplied by the percentage of the course completed during that period. We use this metric to account for the fact that many courses
offered by our clients straddle two or more fiscal quarters. For example, if a course had 25 enrolled students and 40% of the course was completed during a particular period, we would count the course
as having 10 full course equivalent enrollments for that period. Any individual student may be enrolled in more than one course during a period. Average
revenue per full course equivalent enrollment represents our weighted-average revenue per course across the mix of courses being offered in our client programs during a period.
This number is derived by dividing our total revenue for a period by the number of full course equivalent enrollments during that same period. This amount may vary from period to period depending on
the academic calendars of our clients, the relative growth rates of programs with varying tuition levels, the launch of new programs with higher or lower than average net tuition costs and annual
tuition increases instituted by our clients. As a part of our growth strategy, we are actively targeting new 52 Table of Contents graduate-level
clients in academic disciplines for which we have existing programs. Over time, this strategy is likely to reduce our average revenue per full course equivalent. However, we believe
this approach will enable us to leverage our program marketing investments across multiple client programs within specific academic disciplines, significantly decreasing student acquisition costs
within those disciplines and more than offsetting any decline in average revenue per full course equivalent enrollment. The
following table sets forth the full course equivalent enrollments and average revenue per full course equivalent enrollment in our clients' programs for the periods presented. Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Full course equivalent enrollments in our clients' programs 41,034 31,338 22,532 Average revenue per full course equivalent enrollment in our clients' programs $ 2,687 $ 2,653 $ 2,480 Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA represents our earnings before net interest (income) expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted to
eliminate stock-based compensation expense, which is a non-cash item. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating
performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short- and long-term operational plans. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating adjusted EBITDA
can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business. Accordingly, we believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding
and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Adjusted
EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of financial performance calculated and
presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate adjusted
EBITDA in the same manner that we do. We prepare adjusted EBITDA to eliminate the impact of stock-based compensation expense, which we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance. Our
use of adjusted EBITDA has limitation as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under
U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are:  although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the
future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;  adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;  adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation;  adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest or tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and  other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a
comparative measure. 53 Table of Contents Because
of these and other limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA alongside other U.S. GAAP-based financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics,
net income (loss) and our other U.S. GAAP results. The following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA (loss) to net loss for each of the periods indicated: Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 (in thousands) Net loss $ (28,999 ) $ (27,953 ) $ (23,113 ) Adjustments: Interest expense 1,213 (27 ) 73 Interest income (92 ) (26 ) (38 ) Depreciation and amortization expense 5,572 4,335 2,869 Stock-based compensation expense 7,527 2,426 1,395 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total adjustments 14,220 6,708 4,299 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Adjusted EBITDA (loss) $ (14,779 ) $ (21,245 ) $ (18,814 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Components of Operating Results Revenue Substantially all of our revenue consists of a contractually specified percentage of the amounts our clients bill to their students for
tuition and fees, less credit card fees and other specified charges we have agreed to exclude in certain of our client contracts, which we refer to as net program proceeds. Most of our contracts have
10 to 15 year initial terms, though one is longer. We recognize revenue ratably over the service period, which we define as the first through the last day of classes for each semester in a
client's program. We
establish a refund allowance for our share of tuition and fees ultimately uncollected by our clients. We
also offered rebates to a limited group of students who enrolled in a specific client program between 2009 and 2011, which we will be required to pay to such students if they complete
their degrees and pre-specified, post-graduation work requirements within a defined period of time after graduation. For students in this group who are still enrolled in the program, we accrue the
rebate liability as they continue through the program towards graduation. In addition, all students in this group are required to certify to us each September as to their continuing eligibility for
these rebates. For those students who do not make such certification and are therefore no longer eligible for the rebate, because, for example, they have failed to meet their post-graduation work
requirements, we reduce the allowance accordingly at that time. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, 130 and 323 students, respectively, remained eligible to receive these rebates. These rebates
and refunds offset the net program proceeds that we recognize as revenue. 54 Table of Contents The following table details the components of our revenue for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 (in thousands) Net program proceeds $ 110,236 $ 83,563 $ 56,760 Rebates 932 320 (240 ) Refunds (838 ) (863 ) (641 ) Other (91 ) 107  ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Revenue $ 110,239 $ 83,127 $ 55,879 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ In
addition to providing access to the cloud-based technology within our Platform, we provide technology-enabled services that support the complete lifecycle of a higher education
program, including attracting students, advising prospective students through the admissions application process, providing technical, success coaching and other support, facilitating accessibility to
individuals with disabilities, and facilitating in-program field placements. We have determined that no individual deliverable has standalone value upon delivery and, therefore, the multiple
deliverables within our arrangements do not qualify for treatment as separate units of accounting. Accordingly, we consider all deliverables to be a single unit of accounting and we recognize revenue
from the entire arrangement over the term of the service period. We
generally receive payments from our clients early in each semester, prior to completion of the service period. We record these advance payments as deferred revenue until the services
are delivered or until our obligations are otherwise met, at which time we recognize the revenue. As of each balance sheet date, deferred revenue is a current liability and represents the excess
amounts we have billed or received over the amounts we have recognized as revenue in the consolidated statements of operations as of that date. Costs and Expenses Costs and expenses consist of servicing and support costs, technology and content development costs, program marketing and sales
expenses and general and administrative expenses. To support our anticipated growth, we expect to continue to hire new employees, increase our program promotion and student acquisition efforts, expand
our technology infrastructure and increase our other program support capabilities. As a result, we expect our costs and expenses to increase in absolute dollars, but to decrease as a percentage of
revenue over time as we achieve economies of scale through the expansion of our business. Servicing and support. Servicing and support costs consist primarily of compensation costs related to program management and operations, as well as
costs for technical support for our SaaS technology and faculty and student support. It includes costs to facilitate in-program field placements, student immersions and other student enrichment
experiences, and to assist our clients with their state compliance requirements. It also includes software licensing, telecommunications and other costs to provide access to the SaaS technology within
our Platform for our clients and their students. Technology and content development. Technology and content development costs consist primarily of compensation and outsourced services
costs related
to the ongoing improvement and maintenance of the SaaS technology within our Platform, and the developed content for our client programs. It also includes the costs to support our internal
infrastructure, including our cloud-based server usage. Additionally, it includes the associated depreciation and amortization expense related to internally developed software and content, as well as
hosting and other costs associated with maintaining the SaaS technology within our Platform in a cloud environment. 55 Table of Contents Program marketing and sales. Program marketing and sales expense consists primarily of costs related to student acquisition. This
includes the cost
of online advertising and prospective student generation, as well as compensation costs for our program marketing, search engine optimization, marketing analytics and admissions application counseling
personnel. We expense all costs related to program marketing and sales as they are incurred. General and administrative. General and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation costs for employees in our executive,
administrative, finance and accounting, legal, communications and human resources functions. Additional expenses include external legal, accounting and other professional fees, telecommunications
charges and other corporate costs such as insurance and travel that are not related to another function. Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) consists of interest income and interest expense. Interest income is derived from interest received on our cash
and cash equivalents. Interest expense consists primarily of the amortization of deferred financing costs associated with our line of credit and convertible notes prior to their conversion and changes
in our preferred stock warrant liability as a result of changes in the fair value of such warrants (through April 2, 2014). The
fair value of our preferred stock warrant liability was reassessed at the end of each reporting period and any increase in fair value was recognized in other expense, while any
decrease in fair value was recognized in other income. Upon completion of our initial public offering, the preferred stock warrants automatically became warrants to purchase common stock. At that
time, we reclassified the preferred stock warrant liability to additional paid-in capital and no further changes in fair value will be recognized in other income or expense. Income Tax (Expense) Benefit Income tax expense consists of U.S. federal, state and foreign income taxes. To date, we have not been required to pay U.S. federal
income taxes because of our current and accumulated net operating losses. We incurred immaterial state and foreign income tax liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. 56 Table of Contents Results of Operations Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 The following table sets forth selected consolidated statement of operations data for each of the periods indicated.

Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $110.2 million, an increase of $27.1 million, or 32.6%, from
$83.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Of the increase, $14.3 million was primarily attributable to increases period-over-period full course equivalent enrollments in
the client programs that launched in 2013. Increases in full-course equivalent enrollments in the four client programs launched prior to January 1, 2013 resulted in higher period-over-period
revenues of $9.4 million, while programs that launched in 2014 contributed $2.8 million. In addition, our rebate liability decreased, which resulted in a corresponding increase in our
revenue by $0.6 million. The decrease in the rebate liability was the result of some students not certifying their continuing eligibility for the rebate program and fewer of the original cohort
of students still being enrolled in the applicable client program and, therefore, a reduction in the rate of rebate liability accrual during the period. Servicing and support. Servicing and support costs for the year ended December 31, 2014 were
$26.8 million, an increase of $4.1 million, or 18.2%, from $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was due primarily to a $3.1 million
increase in compensation costs, and a $0.5 million increase in travel and related expenses as we increased our headcount in this area by 27% to serve a growing number of students and faculty in
existing and new client programs. The remaining increase of $0.5 million was primarily attributable to increased costs associated with student immersions and on-campus initiatives. As a
percentage of revenue, servicing and support costs decreased from 27.3% for the year ended December 31, 2013 to 24.4% for the same period of 2014, as client programs continued to mature and
greater operational efficiencies were achieved. Technology and content development. Technology and content development costs for the year ended December 31, 2014 were
$22.6 million,
an increase of $3.1 million, or 16.2%, from $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. This was due primarily to a $2.2 million increase in 57 Table of Contents compensation
costs (net of capitalized amounts for software and content development) and higher travel and related expenses of $0.3 million, as we increased our headcount in this area by 30% to
support additional client program launches and scaling of existing client programs. Further, an increase of $0.9 million resulted from higher depreciation expense associated with our
capitalized internal use software and content development costs, primarily as a result of an increase in the number of courses that have been developed for our client programs. Additionally, costs
related to equipment expenditures and our cloud-based server usage increased by $0.7 million and $0.7 million, respectively, to support a greater number of our clients' programs. These
increases were offset by lower curriculum development and production expenditures of $1.3 million, primarily related to the discontinuation of a pilot program, and other cost savings of
$0.4 million. As a percentage of revenue, technology and content development costs decreased from 23.4% for the year ended December 31, 2013 to 20.5% for the same period of 2014, driven
by our increased revenue. Program marketing and sales. Program marketing and sales expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $65.2 million, an
increase of
$11.1 million, or 20.5%, from $54.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was due primarily to a $7.4 million increase in compensation costs, as we
increased our headcount in this area by 37% to acquire students for, and drive revenue growth in, new client programs. Additionally, prospective student generation costs increased by a total of
$3.5 million to acquire students for our clients' programs, while other program marketing and sales expenses increased by $0.2 million. As a percentage of revenue, program marketing and
sales expense decreased from 65.1% for year ended December 31, 2013 to 59.2% for the same period of 2014, reflecting a higher year-over-year percentage increase in revenue than the
corresponding increase in program marketing and sales expense. General and administrative. General and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $23.4 million, an
increase of
$8.6 million, or 57.8%, from $14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. This was due primarily to a $5.7 million increase in compensation costs and
$0.7 million increase in travel and related expenses, as we increased our headcount in this area by 19% to support our growing business. Additionally, employee education benefit costs increased
by $0.8 million, while legal, accounting and other professional fees increased by $0.8 million. Further, insurance costs increased by $0.3 million due to the purchase of directors
and officers liability coverage and other general and administrative costs increased by $0.3 million. As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expense increased from 17.9% for the
year ended December 31, 2013 to 21.2% for the same period of 2014. 58 Table of Contents Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 The following table sets forth selected consolidated statement of operations data for each of the periods indicated.

Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $83.1 million, an increase of $27.2 million, or 48.8%, from
$55.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Of the increase, $24.2 million was primarily attributable to increased period-over-period full course equivalent enrollments in
the four client programs launched prior to January 1, 2013. An additional $2.4 million was attributable to full course equivalent enrollments in the new client programs that launched
during 2013. In addition, our rebate liability decreased, which resulted in a corresponding increase in our revenue of $0.6 million. The decrease in the rebate liability was the result of some
students not certifying their continuing eligibility for the rebate program and fewer of the original cohort of students still being enrolled in the applicable client program and, therefore, a
reduction in the rate of rebate liability accrual during the period. Servicing and support. Servicing and support costs for the year ended December 31, 2013 were $22.7 million, an increase of
$7.8 million, or 52.2%, from $14.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2012. This increase was due primarily to a $5.9 million increase in compensation costs, as we increased our headcount in this area by 30% to serve a growing number of students and faculty in
existing and new client programs. The remaining increase of $1.9 million was primarily attributable to increase costs for software licensing and facilitating in-program field placements,
student immersions and student enrichment experiences. As a percentage of revenue, servicing and support costs increased from 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2012 to 27.3% for the year
ended December 31, 2013, as five additional client programs launched in 2013 and we began to incur expenses in anticipation of the revenue we expect to generate through these new programs. Technology and content development. Technology and content development costs were $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013,
an increase of $11.2 million, or 134.6%, from $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. This was due primarily to a $3.9 million increase in external technology
consulting costs and a $3.8 million increase in compensation costs (net of 59 Table of Contents capitalized
amounts for software and content development), as we increased our headcount in this area by 67% to support additional client program launches and scaling of existing client programs.
Further, an increase of $1.4 million was attributable to increased costs for telecommunication, travel, computer hardware and other expenses. Additionally, an increase of $1.3 million
resulted from higher depreciation expense associated with our capitalized internal use software and content development costs, primarily as a result of an increase in the number of courses that have
been developed for our client programs. The remaining increase of $0.8 million resulted primarily from higher costs related to our cloud-based server usage. As a percentage of revenue,
technology and content development costs increased from 14.9% for the year ended December 31, 2012 to 23.4% for the year ended December 31, 2013, as additional client programs launched
and we began to incur expenses in advance of revenue generated through these new programs. Program marketing and sales. Program marketing and sales expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $54.1 million, an
increase of
$8.7 million, or 19.2%, from $45.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was due primarily to a $4.3 million increase in compensation costs, as we
increased our headcount in this area by 26% to acquire students for, and drive revenue growth in, new client programs. Additionally, prospective student generation costs increased by a total of
$3.3 million, and other general program marketing and sales expenses, including advertising design, printing, public relations and advertisement hosting fees, increased by a total of
$1.1 million, as we continued to expand our program marketing efforts to acquire students for our clients' programs. As a percentage of revenue, program marketing and sales expense decreased
from 81.2% for the year ended December 31, 2012 to 65.1% for the year ended December 31, 2013, reflecting a higher year-over-year percentage increase in revenue than the corresponding
increase in program marketing and sales expense. General and administrative. General and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $14.8 million, an
increase of
$4.5 million, or 43.5%, from $10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. This was due primarily to a $2.4 million increase in compensation costs, driven by
increased employee bonus and stock-based compensation expense of $1.5 million and increased wages of $0.9 million, as we increased our headcount in this area by 2% to support our growing
business and prepared to operate as a public company. Additionally, our legal, accounting and other professional fees increased by $1.2 million in preparation for our initial public offering,
travel costs increased by $0.4 million driven by the increase in personnel and other general and administrative expenses increased by $0.5 million. As a percentage of revenue, general
and administrative expense decreased from 18.5% for the year ended December 31, 2012 to 17.9% for the year ended December 31, 2013, reflecting a higher year-over-year percentage increase
in revenue than the corresponding increase in general and administrative expense. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates This management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be
reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates if conditions differ from our assumptions. While
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included in Part II, Item 8 of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K, 60 Table of Contents we
believe the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue We recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
(ii) rendering of services is complete, (iii) fees are fixed or determinable and (iv) collection of fees is reasonably assured. We
primarily derive our revenue from long term contracts that typically range from 10 to 15 years in length. Under these contracts, we enable access to our cloud-based technology
Platform and provide technology-enabled marketing, content development and supporting services to our clients and their faculty and students. We are entitled to a contractually specified percentage of
net program proceeds from our clients. These net program proceeds represent gross proceeds billed by our clients to students, less credit card fees and other specified charges we have agreed to
exclude in certain of our client contracts. A refund allowance is established for our share of tuition and fees ultimately uncollected by our clients. We also offered rebates to a group of students
who enrolled in a specific client program between 2009 and 2011, which we will pay to the student if he or she completes the degree and certain post-graduation work requirements within a specified
period of time. These rebates and refunds offset the net program proceeds recognized as revenue. Revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, which we define as the first through the last
day of classes for each semester in a client's program. We invoice our clients based on enrollment reports that are generated by our clients. In some instances, these enrollment reports are received
prior to the conclusion of the drop/add period. In such cases, we establish a reserve against revenue, if necessary, based on our estimate of changes in enrollments expected prior to the end of the
drop/add period. We
generate substantially all of our revenue from multiple-deliverable contractual arrangements with our clients. Under each of these arrangements, we provide (i) a cloud-based
technology Platform that serves as a learning platform for our client's faculty and students and which also enables a comprehensive range of other client functions, (ii) program marketing and
application services for student acquisition, (iii) in conjunction with the client's faculty members, content development for courses and (iv) faculty and student support services,
including technical field training and support, non-academic student advising and academic progress monitoring. In
order to treat deliverables in a multiple-deliverable contractual arrangement as separate units of accounting, deliverables must have standalone value upon delivery. The services are
provided primarily in support of courses offered over our Platform and for students of the online courses delivered over its Platform. Accordingly, we haves determined that no individual deliverable
has standalone value upon delivery and, therefore, deliverables within our multiple-deliverable arrangements do not qualify for treatment as separate units of accounting. Accordingly, we consider all
deliverables to be a single unit of accounting and recognize revenue from the entire arrangement over the term of the service period. Advance
payments are recorded as deferred revenue until the services are delivered or obligations are met, at which time revenue is recognized. Deferred revenue as of a particular
balance sheet date represents the excess of amounts received as compared to amounts recognized in revenue in the consolidated statements of operations as of the end of the reporting period, and such
amounts are reflected as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheets. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Our accounts receivable are stated at realizable value. We extend a minimal amount of uncollateralized credit to our clients. We
utilize the allowance method to provide for doubtful accounts based on management's evaluation of the collectability of the amounts due. Our estimate is based on 61 Table of Contents historical
collection experience and a review of the current status of accounts receivable. Historically, actual write-offs for uncollectible accounts have not significantly differed from our
estimates. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we determined that no significant allowances for doubtful accounts were necessary. Internally Developed Software Costs We capitalize certain costs associated with internally-developed software, primarily consisting of direct labor associated with
creating the software. Software development projects generally include three stages: the preliminary project stage (all costs are expensed as incurred), the application development stage (certain
costs are capitalized and certain costs are expensed as incurred) and the post-implementation/operation stage (all costs are expensed as incurred). Costs capitalized in the application development
stage include costs of designing the application, coding, integrating our and the university's networks and systems, and the testing of the software. Capitalization of costs requires judgment in
determining when a project has reached the application development stage and the period over which we expect to benefit from the use of that software. Once the software is placed in service, these
costs are depreciated on a straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which is generally three to five years. Capitalized Content Development Costs We work with each of our clients' faculty members to develop and maintain educational content that is delivered to their students
through our cloud-based technology Platform. The online content developed jointly by us and our clients consists of subjects chosen and taught by client's faculty members and incorporates references
and examples designed to remain relevant over extended periods of time. Online delivery of the content, combined with live, face-to-face instruction, provides us with rapid user feedback, which we use
to make ongoing corrections, modifications and improvements to the course content. Our clients retain all intellectual property rights to the developed content, although we retain the rights to the
content packaging and delivery mechanisms. Much of our new content development uses proven delivery platforms and is therefore primarily subject-specific in nature. As a result, a significant portion
of content development costs qualify for capitalization due to the focus of our development efforts on the unique subject matter of the content. Similar to on-campus programs offered by our clients,
the online degree programs that we enable offer numerous courses for each degree. We therefore capitalize our development costs on a course-by-course basis. As students must matriculate into a client
program in order to take a course, revenues and identifiable cash flows are also measured at the client program level. We
develop content on a course-by-course basis in conjunction with the faculty for each client program. The clients and their faculty generally provide course outlines in the form of the
curriculum, required textbooks, case studies and other reading materials, as well as presentations that are typically used in the on-campus setting. We are then responsible for, and incur all of the
expenses related to, the conversion of the materials provided by each client into a format suitable for delivery through our cloud-based technology Platform. The
content development costs that qualify for capitalization are third-party direct costs, such as videography, editing and other services associated with creating digital content.
Additionally, we capitalize internal payroll and payroll-related costs incurred to create and produce videos and other digital content utilized in the clients' programs for delivery via our Platform.
Capitalization ends when content has been fully developed by both us and the client, at which time amortization of the capitalized content development costs begin. The capitalized costs are recorded
on a course-by-course basis and included in capitalized content costs on the consolidated balance sheets. These costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the
respective capitalized content program, which is generally five years. The estimated useful life corresponds with the planned 62 Table of Contents curriculum
refresh rate. This refresh rate is consistent with expected curriculum refresh rates as cited by program faculty members for similar on-campus programs. It is reasonably possible that
developed content could be refreshed before the estimated useful lives are complete. Stock-Based Compensation We have issued two types of stock-based awards under our stock plans: stock options and restricted stock units. Stock-based awards
granted to employees, directors and non-employee third parties are measured at fair value at each grant date. We consider what we believe to be comparable publicly traded companies, discounted free
cash flows, and an analysis of our enterprise value in estimating the fair value of our common stock. For awards subject to service-based vesting conditions, we recognize compensation expense on a
straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, adjusted for estimated forfeitures. Options subject to service-based vesting generally vest at various times from the date of the
grant, with most options vesting in tranches, generally over a period of four years. Restricted stock units subject to service-based vesting generally vest 25% on each anniversary of the grant date
over four years. Some
of the stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2012 were subject to both performance and service-based vesting conditions. We recognize compensation expense
using an accelerated recognition method for awards subject to performance-based vesting conditions when it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. For
the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recorded stock-based compensation expense of $7.5 million, $2.4 million and $1.4 million,
respectively. Information about the assumptions used in the calculation of stock-based compensation expense is set forth in Note 10 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included
in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As
of December 31, 2014, unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested options totaled $9.6 million and will be recognized over a weighted-average period of
approximately 2.3 years. As
of December 31, 2014, unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested restricted stock units was $7.5 million and will be recognized over a weighted-average period
of approximately 3.0 years. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and
liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that are included in the financial statements. Under this method, the deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the
differences between the financial statement and tax bases of the assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a
change in tax rates on the deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in earnings in the period when the new rate is enacted. Deferred tax assets are subject to periodic recoverability
assessments. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that more likely than not will be realized. We consider all positive and negative
evidence relating to the realization of the deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. We currently maintain a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. We
record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We account for uncertainty in income taxes using
a two-step approach for evaluating tax positions. Step one, recognition, occurs when we conclude that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more likely than not to be sustained upon
examination. Step two, measurement, determines the amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all
relevant information. 63 Table of Contents De-recognition
of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur if we subsequently determine that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold of being sustained. We
recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of Liquidity From inception until the closing of our initial public offering on April 2, 2014, we funded our operations primarily through
private placements of redeemable convertible preferred stock. We raised $31.5 million, $26.0 million and $5.0 million from the sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock in 2011, 2012 and 2013,
respectively. In
April 2012, we obtained a line of credit from Comerica Bank under which we were able to borrow up to $10.0 million. We never borrowed any amounts under this facility. On
December 31, 2013, we entered into a new credit agreement with Comerica Bank which replaced our prior line of credit with a new revolving line of credit. Under this revolving line of credit, we
may borrow up to $37.0 million from a syndicate of lenders including Comerica Bank and Square 1 Bank. On January 21, 2014, we borrowed $5.0 million under this line of credit and
repaid this borrowing in full on February 18, 2014. There have been no subsequent borrowings under this line of credit. Under this revolving line of credit, we have the option of borrowing
funds subject to (i) a base rate, which is equal to 1.5% plus the greater of Comerica Bank's prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 1% or the 30 day LIBOR plus 1%, or (ii) LIBOR
plus 2.5%. For amounts borrowed under the base rate, we may make interest-only payments quarterly, and may prepay such amounts with no penalty. For amounts borrowed under LIBOR, we may make
interest-only payments in periods of one, two and three months and will be subject to a prepayment penalty if we repay such borrowed amounts before the end of the interest period. Borrowings
under the line of credit are collateralized by substantially all of our assets. The availability of borrowings under this credit line is subject to our compliance with
reporting and financial covenants, including, among other things, that we achieve specified minimum three-month trailing revenue levels during the term of the agreement and specified minimum six-month
trailing profitability levels for some of our client programs, measured quarterly. In addition, we are required to maintain a minimum adjusted quick ratio, which measures our short term liquidity, of
at least 1.10 to 1.00. The
covenants under the line of credit also place limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness or to prepay permitted indebtedness, grant liens on or security interests in
our assets, carry out mergers and acquisitions, dispose of assets, declare, make or pay dividends, make capital expenditures in excess of specified amounts, make investments, loans or advances, enter
into transactions with our affiliates, amend or modify the terms of our material contracts, or change our fiscal year. If we are not in compliance with the covenants under the line of credit, after
any opportunity to cure such non-compliance, or we otherwise experience an event of default under the line of credit, the lenders may require repayment in full of all principal and interest
outstanding. If we fail to repay such amounts, the lenders could foreclose on the assets we have pledged as collateral under the line of credit. We are currently in compliance with all such covenants. On
April 2, 2014, we closed our initial public offering in which we issued and sold 8,626,377 shares of common stock resulting in net proceeds of $100.3 million. Refer to

cash at December 31, 2014 was held for working capital purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. We invest any cash in excess of our
immediate requirements in investments designed to preserve the principal balance and provide liquidity.
Accordingly, our cash is invested primarily in demand deposit accounts that are currently providing only a minimal return. Cash Flows Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash used in operating activities of $11.7 million consisted of a net loss of
$29.0 million, partially offset by $13.8 million in non-cash items and a $3.5 million net cash inflow from changes in working capital. Non-cash items consisted of non-cash stock
compensation charges of $7.5 million and depreciation, amortization expense of $5.6 million and an increase of $0.7 million related to the change in the fair value of the
Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants prior to their conversion to additional paid-in capital upon the closing of the initial public offering. The increase in cash resulting
from changes in working capital consisted of an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $5.6 million primarily due to higher accrued program marketing costs, a decrease in
accounts receivable of $1.5 million, partially offset by decreases in accounts payable of $2.5 million, our rebate reserve of $0.9 million as the number of students who remained
eligible to receive rebates decreased, and other decreases of $0.2 million. For
the year ended December 31, 2013, net cash used in operating activities of $15.7 million consisted of a net loss of $28.0 million, reduced by $7.6 million
in non-cash items and a $4.7 million net cash inflow from changes in working capital. Non-cash items consisted primarily of depreciation and amortization expense of $4.3 million and
non-cash stock compensation charges of $2.4 million. The increase in cash resulting from changes in working capital consisted primarily of an increase in accrued expenses and other current
liabilities of $5.0 million primarily due to higher program marketing cost accruals to support a greater number of client programs, partially offset by other net decreases of
$0.3 million. For
the year ended December 31, 2012, net cash used in operating activities of $20.2 million consisted of a net loss of $23.1 million, reduced by $4.3 million
in non-cash expenses and increased by a $1.4 million net cash outflow from changes in working capital. Non-cash expenses consisted primarily of depreciation and amortization expense of
$2.9 million and non-cash stock compensation charges of $1.4 million. The decrease in cash resulting from changes in working capital consisted primarily of a 65 Table of Contents $5.0 million
decrease in deferred revenue as our clients' semesters concluded and a $0.3 million increase in prepaid expenses and related party receivables. These amounts were partially
offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $1.1 million driven by cash receipt timing differences, an increase in accounts payable of $1.3 million, an increase in the accrual for
expected refunds of $0.2 million and an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $1.0 million related to increased program accruals as we supported a greater number
of degree offerings. Investing Activities For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 net cash used in investing activities was $11.0 million,
$7.6 million and $5.2 million, respectively. In each period, these expenditures were largely for equipment, internally developed software and asynchronous content developed for client
programs. Financing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by financing activities of $102.6 million, consisting primarily
of $100.3 million in net proceeds from our initial public offering. In addition, we received net cash of $2.3 million from the exercise of stock options. For
the year ended December 31, 2013, net cash provided by financing activities was $5.1 million, of which $5.0 million came from the issuance of redeemable
convertible preferred stock and $0.3 million came from the exercise of stock options. These proceeds were partially offset by $0.2 million used to repurchase shares of common stock from
a former employee. For
the year ended December 31, 2012, net cash provided by financing activities was $26.6 million, of which $26.0 million came from the issuance of our
Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock and $0.6 million came from the exercise of stock options. Contractual Obligations and Commitments We have non-cancelable operating leases for our office space, and we are also contractually obligated to make fixed payments to certain
of our university clients in exchange for various intellectual property and other rights. We
have a $37.0 million line of credit from Comerica Bank and Square 1 Bank. On January 21, 2014, we borrowed $5.0 million under this line of credit and repaid this
borrowing in full on February 18, 2014. There have been no subsequent borrowings under this line of credit, and therefore, no amounts were outstanding as of December 31, 2014. The
following table summarizes our obligations under non-cancelable operating leases and commitments to certain of our clients for various intellectual property and other rights at
December 31, 2014. Future events could cause actual payments to differ from these amounts.
