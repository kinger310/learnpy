 DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION The following discussion
and analysis should be read together with our financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this Report. This
discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. See “Forward-Looking
Statements” for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. Actual results
and the timing of events could differ materially from those discussed in our forward-looking statements as a result of many factors,
including those set forth under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Report. Overview of Business We are a development
stage company. Our mission is to pursue, develop and market full-color volumetric 3D technology. Through a SRA with the University
of Oklahoma, we have obtained the exclusive worldwide marketing rights to certain 3D display technologies under development by
the University. The developments to date have resulted in the University filing seven provisional patents; six of the seven provisional
patents have been combined and converted to four utility patents. On May 26, 2009, the United States Patent and Trademark Office
(“USPTO”) approved the pending patent called "Volumetric Liquid Crystal Display" for rendering a three-dimensional
image and converted it to US patent No. 7,537,345. On December 28, 2010, USPTO approved the pending patent called “Light
Surface Display for Rendering a Three-Dimensional Image,” and issued the United States Patent No. 7,858,913. On
December 13, 2011, USPTO approved a continuation patent called “3D Light Surface Display,” and issued the US Patent
No. 8,075,139. On August 21, 2012, the USPTO approved a continuation patent called “3D Volumetric Display” and issued
the US Patent No. 8,247,755. These patents describe what we are calling our CSpace technology. At this time, we do not own any
intellectual property rights in these technologies, and, apart from the SRA with the University, have no contracts or agreements
pending to acquire such rights or any other interest in such rights. We plan to market the technology and the intellectual property
developed by the University and our staff by targeting various industries, such as retail, manufacturing, entertainment, medical,
healthcare, transportation, homeland security and the military. On April 6, 2009, we filed a provisional patent on an emissive
two-dimensional screen that is controlled and driven by a standard digital light projector or other optical input source. This
provisional patent is called "Flexible/Inflexible Front/Back Projection screen or display" and owned solely by 3DIcon
Corporation. Through the current agreement with the University of Oklahoma, the University filed a continuation
patent application on November 19, 2010, called “3D Light Surface Display”. This application provides additional
protections of our CSpace technology. 22 Since March of 2012,
the Company has been evaluating a number of second-generation, glasses-free flat screen 3D display technologies and the companies
that are developing these technologies with the possibility of an acquisition of such a company in mind. Our goal was
to identify a new technology that could deliver significantly better performance (3D impact and image quality) than current large
area multiple-viewer glasses-free 3D flat screen displays without compromising resolution and brightness, as do current displays. The
ideal company would also have a great technical team, a broad patent portfolio, and a credible technology roadmap to ensure that
these competitive advantages are sustainable into the future. As a result of the above evaluation process, the Company previously
entered into a non-binding Letter of Intent to acquire Dimension Technologies, Inc. (DTI) www.dti3d.com located in Rochester,
NY. However, that Letter of Intent has since expired. Notwithstanding the expiration of the Letter of Intent, the Company’s
interest in a potential acquisition of a small 3D flat screen display company remains. Currently, we do not have any agreements
in place that would allow entry into the flat screen segment of the glasses-free 3D display industry or digital signage industry
and no assurances can be made that such an agreement will ever be consummated. The Company is not actively seeking such
acquisitions in the glasses-free 3D flat screen display segment at this time. Reverse Stock Split On April 27, 2012, the
Company filed an Amended Certificate of Incorporation to effect a 1-for-35 reverse split of the Company’s common stock. The
reverse stock split was announced by Financial Industry Regulatory Authority on April 26, 2012 and became effective on April 27,
2012. As previously reported on the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K, filed on October 20, 2011, this action followed
a stockholder vote at the Company’s annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company, which vote authorized the Company’s
Board of Directors to effect a reverse stock split of the Company’s authorized, issued and outstanding common stock. On April 27, 2012, the
effective date, every 35 shares of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock were combined into one share of common
stock. The Company did not issue any fractional shares in connection with the reverse stock split. Stockholders of record who otherwise
would have been entitled to receive fractional shares will be entitled, upon surrender to our transfer agent of certificates representing
such shares, cash in lieu thereof. Throughout this report,
each instance which refers to a number of shares of our common stock refers to the number of shares of common stock after giving
effect to the April 27, 2012 Reverse Split, unless otherwise indicated. References to a number of shares of common
stock in our historical financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 are reported on a post-Reverse Split
basis. Critical Accounting Policies The Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC") defines "critical accounting policies" as those that require application of management's
most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that
are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Not all of the accounting policies require management to make difficult,
subjective or complex judgments or estimates. However, the following policies could be deemed to be critical within the SEC definition. 23 Research and Development Costs The Company expenses
all research and development costs as incurred. Until we have developed a commercial product, all costs incurred in connection
with the SRA with the University, as well as all other research and development costs incurred, will be expensed as incurred. After
a commercial product has been developed, we will report costs incurred in producing products for sale as assets, but we will continue
to expense costs incurred for further product research and development activities. Stock-Based Compensation Since its inception 3DIcon
has used its common stock or warrants to purchase its common stock as a means of compensating our employees and consultants. Financial
Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") guidance on accounting for share based payments requires us to estimate the value
of securities used for compensation and to charge such amounts to expense over the periods benefited. The estimated fair value
at date of grant of options for our common stock is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, as follows: The expected dividend
yield is based on the average annual dividend yield as of the grant date. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility
of our stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity rates as of the grant date. The expected
life of the option is based on historical exercise behavior and expected future experience. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue
when services are performed, and at the time of shipment of products, provided that evidence of an arrangement exists, title and
risk of loss have passed to the customer, fees are fixed or determinable, and collection of the related receivable is reasonably
assured. We recognize grant revenue
in the month earned in accordance with the terms of the grant agreement. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements. Significant estimates made in preparing these financial statements
include the estimate of useful lives of property and equipment, the deferred tax valuation allowance, and the fair value of stock
options. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The following methods
and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument held by the Company: Current assets and
current liabilities - The carrying value approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these items. Debentures payable - The fair value of the Company's debentures payable has been estimated by the Company based upon the liability's characteristics,
including interest rate. The carrying value approximates fair value. 24 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements See the Recently Issued
Accounting Standards section of Note 3 to our Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further details
of recent accounting pronouncements. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED
DECEMBER 31, 2014 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 Revenue The Company received
$70,748 and $43,896 from the OCAST grant for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In January 2008 we launched
our first software product Pixel Precision. We appointed Digital Light Innovations for the sales and distribution of this product
in March 2008. We have earned income of $15,000 and $4,500 before commissions and costs from the sales of Pixel Precision for the
years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. We expect sales of Pixel
Precision to the installed and active user base of the earlier D1100 and D3000 systems in the near term and as companion product
sales to D4000 systems. We expect that the revenue from this product to offset operating expenses (general and administrative,
research and development, interest) but do not expect the revenue generated in 2015 to cover the operating expenses. Research and Development Expenses The research and development
expenses were $198,550 for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $372,984 for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease
was a result of the termination of agreements with outside research and development consultants of approximately $116,000, a decrease
in lab supplies and equipment of approximately $45,000 a decrease in patent cost of approximately $8,000 and a decrease in the
costs incurred for travel, meals, lodging and conference fees of $29,000, and an increase of $22,000 for the value of shares issued
for the Technical Advisory Board. General and Administrative Expenses Our general and administrative
expenses were $1,065,167 for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $1,077,106 for the year ended December 31, 2013. The
net decrease is due to a decrease in legal fees of $156,000 primarily due to the Depositary Trust Company (“DTC”) inquiry
in 2013, a decrease of $44,000 in travel and related expense, a decrease in filing fees of $14,000 due to fewer filing in 2014
and a decrease in accounting fees of $4,000. These decreases were offset by an increase of financing fees of $78,000 primarily
due to the 3a 10 settlement agreement, an increase of $63,000 in consultant fees, an increase of $56,000 in marketing and public
relation consultant fees, an increase of $6,000 for the shareholders’ briefing, and an increase of $3,000 in insurance. Interest Expense Interest expense for
the year ended December 31, 2014 was $75,735 as compared to $80,355 for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in interest
expense resulted from the decrease of $15,000 extension fee incurred in 2013 and an increase in interest paid on our outstanding
debentures and bridge notes. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital
Resources Management remains focused
on controlling cash expenses. We recognize our limited cash resources and plan our expenses accordingly. We intend to leverage
stock-for-services wherever possible. The operating budget consists of the following expenses: · Research and development expenses pursuant to our development of an initial demonstrable prototype and a second prototype for static volume technology. · Acceleration of research and development through increased research personnel as well as other research agencies. 25 · General and administrative expenses: salaries, insurance, investor related expenses, rent, travel, website, etc. · Hiring executive officers for technology, operations and finance. · Development, support and operational costs related to Pixel Precision software. · Professional fees for accounting and audit; legal services for securities and financing; patent research and protection. Our independent registered
public accountants, in their audit report accompanying our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014, expressed
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern due to our status as a development stage organization with insufficient
revenues to fund development and operating expenses. We had net cash of $34,485
at December 31, 2014. We had negative working
capital of $949,826 at December 31, 2014. During the year ended
December 31, 2014, we used $650,414 of cash for operating activities, a decrease of $412,525 or 39% compared to the year ended
December 31, 2013. The decrease in the use of cash for operating activities was a result of the decrease in the net loss of approximately
$228,000 and the decrease in stock and options issued for service of approximately $187,000 and the change in accounts payable
and accrued liabilities in 2014 of approximately $363,000. Cash used in investing
activities during the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $-0-. Cash provided by financing
activities during the year ended December 31, 2014 was $614,130, a decrease of $518,228 or 46% compared to the year ended December
31, 2013. The decrease was the result of a decrease in funding under the terms of the convertible debentures from Golden
State and bridge notes issued in 2013 of approximately $498,000 less the cash payment of $140,680 on the Global Capital/CPUS debenture. We expect to fund the
ongoing operations through the existing financing in place (see below); through raising additional funds as permitted by the terms
of Golden State financing as well as reducing our monthly expenses. Our ability to fund the
operations of the Company is highly dependent on the underlying stock price of the Company. On November 3, 2006,
the Company issued to Golden State a 4.75% convertible debenture in a principal amount of $100,000, due December 2015 as a result
of a maturity extension agreement received by the Company in March 2015, and warrants to buy25,571 shares of the common stock at
an exercise price of $381.50 per share. In connection with each conversion, Golden State is expected to simultaneously exercise
a percentage of warrants equal to the percentage of the principal being converted. During 2013, Golden State converted $3,860 of
the $100,000 debenture into 37,651,544 shares of common stock, exercised warrants to purchase 1,103 shares of common stock at $381.50
per share based on the formula in the convertible debenture. Additionally Golden State advanced $671,810 against future exercises
of warrants of which $420,740 was applied to the exercise of warrants leaving $185,671 of unapplied advances at December 31, 2013.
During 2014, Golden State converted $4,710 of the $100,000 debenture into 98,093,643 shares of common stock, exercised warrants
to purchase 1,347 shares of common stock at $381.50 per share based on the formula in the convertible debenture. Additionally Golden
State advanced $349,310 against future exercises of warrants of which $513,390 was applied to the exercise of warrants leaving
$21,591 of unapplied advances at December 31, 2014. In September 2013, the
Company was awarded a grant from Oklahoma Center for the Advancement of Science and Technology (“OCAST”). This matching
grant is for $300,000 and had a start date of January 1, 2014. The Company earned $70,748 and $43,896 from the grant during the
year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 respectively. The money is being used to support the development of the Company’s first
Product Platform, which will be the basis for a family of products based on the Company’s CSpace® volumetric 3D display
technology. 26 On December 1, 2010 the
Company entered into an agreement with the University pursuant to which the University agreed to convert all sums due to it from
the Company in connection with its SRA with the Company, which as of December 1, 2010 amounted to approximately $485,000, into
an aggregate of 1,685,714 shares of the Company's common stock. As a result of the debt conversion, the University became the holder
of approximately 8% of the outstanding common stock of the Company. Pursuant to the agreement, the shares are subject to a put
option allowing the University to require the Company to purchase certain of the shares upon the occurrence of certain events.
In addition, the shares are subject to a call option allowing the Company to require the University to sell to the Company the
shares then held by the University in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The put options and the call options expired
on November 30, 2014 and the Shares are no longer subject to such options. Director Debenture On June 24, 2013, the
Company issued to Victor Keen and Martin Keating, Directors of the Company, (“Directors”) 10% convertible debentures
in a principal amount of $15,000 each, due June 26, 2014 and subsequently extended to December 26, 2014 and again extended to June
30, 2015. The Directors may elect to convert all or any portion of the outstanding principal amount of the debentures at an exercise
price of $0.01 per share. Provided that the debentures are paid in full on or before the maturity date, no interest shall
accrue on the unpaid balance of the principal amount. In the event that the debentures are not paid in full on or before the maturity
date, interest shall accrue on the unpaid outstanding balance of the principal amount of the debentures from June 26, 2013, until
paid, at the fixed rate of ten percent (10%) per annum. Newton, O'Connor, Turner & Ketchum
10% Convertible Debenture On December 20, 2012,
the Company issued to Newton, O'Connor, Turner & Ketchum (“NOTK”) a 10% convertible debenture in a principal amount
of $29,007, initially due September 30, 2013 and extended to December 31, 2014 and subsequently extended to June 30, 2015. NOTK may elect to convert all or any portion of the outstanding principal amount of the debenture at an exercise price of $0.02534
per share. The Company was indebted to NOTK for legal services performed for the Company and reimbursement of expenses in rendition
of those services for the period ended December 31, 2012. The debenture was issued in settlement of the indebtedness. 5% Convertible Bridge Notes On June 6, 2012 and August
1, 2012, the Company issued and sold convertible promissory notes (the “5% Notes") in aggregate principal amount of
$415,000 to JMJ Financial (“JMJ”). The 5% Notes includes a $40,000 original issue discount (the “OID”)
that will be prorated based on the advances actually paid to the Company. During 2012, JMJ advanced $150,000 on the 5% Notes and
earned $14,000 OID. During 2013, JMJ advanced an additional $120,000 on the 5% Notes and earned $32,205 OID and accrued interest. During 2013, JMJ converted $203,700 of the 5% Notes into 31,854,924 shares of common stock at an average of $0.00639 per share
based on the formula in the 5% Notes. During 2014, JMJ advanced an additional $75,000 on the 5% Notes and earned $5,975 OID and
accrued interest. During 2014, JMJ converted $148,680 of the 5% Notes into 47,848,529 shares of common stock at an average
of $0.003 per share based on the formula in the 5% Notes. In addition to the OID, the 5% Notes provides for a one-time interest
charge of 5% to be applied to the principal sum advanced. Pursuant to the terms of 5% Notes, JMJ may, at its election, convert
all or a part of the $275,000 note and the $140,000 note into shares of the Company's common stock at a conversion rate equal to
the lesser of (i) $0.15 and $0.35, respectively or (ii) 70% of the lowest trade price during the twenty-five trading days prior
to JMJ’s election to convert. If the Company repays the 5% Notes on or before ninety days from the date it was issued, the
interest rate will be zero percent. If the Company does not repay the 5% Notes on or before ninety days from the date it was issued,
a one-time interest charge of 5% shall be applied to the principal. The Company did not repay the 5% Notes within the ninety day
period. The principal of the 5% Notes is due one year from the date of each of the principal amounts advanced. The 5% Notes were subject
to a Mandatory Registration Agreement (the “Registration Agreement”) whereby no later than August 31, 2012, the Company
agreed to file, at its own expense, an amendment (the “Amendment”) to the S-1 Registration Statement (the “Registration
Statement”) the Company filed with the SEC on July 3, 2012, to include in such Amendment 4,750,000 shares of common stock
issuable under the 5% Notes. The Company agreed, thereafter, to use its best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become
effective as soon as possible after such filing but in no event later than one hundred and twenty (120) days from the date of the
Registration Agreement. Since the Company failed to get the Registration Statement declared effective within the 120 days of the
date of the Registration Agreement, a penalty/liquidated damages of $25,000 was added to the balance of the 5% Notes. 27 10% Convertible
Bridge Note to Director On September 11, 2012,
the Company issued and sold to Victor F. Keen, a Director and an accredited investor a Convertible Bridge Note (the “Keen
Bridge Note”) in the principal amount of $60,000. The sale of the Keen Bridge Notes in the principal of $60,000 included
a $10,000 OID. Accordingly, the Company received $50,000 gross proceeds. The Keen Bridge Note matured 90 days from the date of
issuance and, other than the OID, the Keen Bridge Note does not carry interest. However, in the event the Keen Bridge Note is not
paid on maturity, all past due amounts will accrue interest at 15% per annum. Upon maturity of the Keen Bridge Note, the holders
of the Keen Bridge Note may elect to convert all or any portion of the outstanding principal amount of the Keen Bridge Note into
(i) securities sold pursuant to an effective registration statement at the applicable offering price; or (ii) shares of common
stock at a conversion price equal to the lesser of 100% of the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP), as reported for the 5 trading
days prior to (a) the date of issuance of the Keen Bridge Note, (b) the maturity date of the Keen Bridge Note, or (c) the first
closing date of the securities sold pursuant an effective registration statement. On January 26, 2013,
the Company entered into an amendment agreement (the “Keen Amendment”) with Mr. Keen. The Pursuant to the Keen Amendment,
Mr. Keen agreed to extend the maturity date of the Keen Bridge Note from December 10, 2012 to April 30, 2013 and to waive any and

Company entered into a second amendment agreement (the “Second Keen Amendment”) with Mr. Keen to amend the Keen Bridge
Note. Pursuant to the Second
Keen Amendment, Mr. Keen agreed to extend the maturity of the Keen Bridge Note from April 30, 2013 to August 31, 2013 (the “New
Maturity Date”) and to waive, if any, existing or prior defaults under the Keen Bridge Note or the Keen SPA and the Company
agreed to (i) amend the conversion provision to allow for conversions based on a conversion price calculated on the Amendment Date
or the New Maturity Date; and (ii) to include an interest rate equal to 10% per annum, payable on the New Maturity Date, as amended,
which accrual shall commence on December 10, 2012. On September 30, 2013,
the Company entered into a third amendment agreement (the “Third Keen Amendment”) with Mr. Keen. Pursuant to the Third
Keen Amendment, Mr. Keen agreed to extend the maturity of the Keen Bridge Note from August 31, 2013 to December 31, 2013 and to
waive, if any, existing or prior defaults under the Keen Bridge Note or the Keen SPA. On January 27, 2014,
the Company entered into a fourth amendment agreement (the “Fourth Keen Amendment”) with Mr. Keen. Pursuant to the
Fourth Keen Amendment, Mr. Keen agreed to extend the maturity of the Keen Bridge Note from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014
and to waive, if any, existing or prior defaults under the Keen Bridge Note or the Keen SPA. On
March 16, 2015 (the “Amendment Date”), the Company entered into a fifth amendment agreement (the “Fifth Keen
Amendment”) with Keen to amend the Keen Bridge note. Pursuant to the Fifth Keen Amendment, Keen agreed to extend the maturity
of the Note from December 31, 2014 to June 30, 2015 (the “New Maturity Date”) and to waive, if any, existing or prior
defaults under the Keen Bridge Note or the Keen SPA. 15% Senior Convertible
Bridge Notes due 2014 On October 1, 2013 (the
“Date of Issuance”), the Company issued and sold to an accredited investor a Senior Convertible Note (the “Senior
Note”) in the principal amount of $205,000 and a warrant to purchase 300,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at
an exercise price equal to 110% of the closing bid price on September 30, 2013 (the “October 2013 Warrant”). The Senior
Note included a $30,750 OID. Accordingly, the Company received $174,250 gross proceeds from which the Company paid legal and documentation
fees of $22,500 and placement agent fees of $15,682. 28 The Senior Note matured
on July 1, 2014 and did not carry interest. However, in the event the Senior Note was not paid on maturity, all past due amounts
would accrue interest at 15% per annum. The Senior Note was paid on maturity and interest was not incurred. At any time subsequent
to six months following the Date of Issuance, the Senior Note holder may elect to convert all or any portion of the outstanding
principal amount of the Senior Note into shares of Common Stock at a conversion price equal to the lesser of 100% of the VWAP,
as reported for the 5 trading days prior to the Date of Issuance or 80% of the average VWAP during the 5 days prior to the date
the holder delivers a conversion notice to the Company. During 2014, the holder of the $205,000 note converted $180,000 of the
note into 83,705,721 common shares at an average price of $0.0021 per share under the terms of the debenture agreement. The remaining
$25,000 balance of the note was paid in cash to retire the note. The estimated fair value
of the warrants for common stock issued of $2,130 was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The expected dividend
yield of zero is based on the average annual dividend yield as of the issue date. Expected volatility of 173.64% is based on the
historical volatility of our stock. The risk-free interest rate of 1.39% is based on the U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity rate
for five years as of the issue date. The expected life of five years of the warrant is based on historical exercise behavior and
expected future experience. The October 2013 Warrant
is exercisable at any time on or after March 31, 2014 and on or prior to the close of business on March 31, 2019. At the election
of the October 2013 Warrant holder, the October 2013 Warrant may be exercised using a cashless exercise method. Effective August 15,
2014, the Company entered into a Securities Settlement Agreement (the “SSA”) with an accredited investor (the “Investor”)
to whom the $205,000 Senior Convertible Note was assigned. Pursuant to the SSA, the Investor agreed to extend the maturity of the
$205,000 principal owed (the “Debt”) under the Senior Note until August 15, 2015 and the Company agreed, among other
things, to (i) pay 10% interest on the Debt; (ii) pay 125% of principal in the event the Company elects to prepay any portion of
the Debt; (iii) allow the Investor to convert the Debt, in whole or in part, into shares of the Company’s common stock at
a conversion price equal to 58% percent of the lowest traded VWAP, determined on the then current trading market for the Company’s
common stock, for the 15 trading days prior to conversion. Settlement Agreement On July 26, 2013, the
Circuit Court in the 12 th Judicial Circuit in and for Sarasota County, Florida (the “Court”), entered
an Order Granting Approval of Settlement Agreement (the “Order”) approving, among other things, the fairness of the
terms and conditions of an exchange pursuant to Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in accordance with
a Settlement Agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) between the Company and IBC Funds, LLC, a Nevada limited liability
company (“IBC”), in the matter entitled IBC Funds, LLC v. 3DIcon Corporation , Case No. 2013 CA 5705 NC
(the “Action”). IBC commenced the Action against the Company on July 19, 2013 to recover an aggregate of $197,631 of
past-due accounts payable of the Company, which IBC had purchased from certain vendors of the Company pursuant to the terms of
separate claim purchase agreements between IBC and each of such vendors (the “Assigned Accounts”), plus fees and costs
(the “Claim”). The Assigned Accounts relate to certain research, technical, development, accounting and legal services. The
Order provides for the full and final settlement of the Claim and the Action. The Settlement Agreement became effective and binding
upon the Company and IBC upon execution of the Order by the Court on July 26, 2013. Pursuant to the terms
of the Settlement Agreement approved by the Order, on July 26, 2013, the Company issued 650,000 shares of Common Stock as a settlement
fee and agreed to issue, in one or more tranches as necessary, that number of shares equal to $197,631 upon conversion to Common
Stock at a conversion rate equal to 65% of the lowest closing bid price of the Common Stock during the ten trading days prior to
the date the conversion is requested by IBC minus $0.002. During 2013, IBC converted $78,789 of the note into 53,720,000
shares of common stock at an average of $0.0015 per share based on the formula in the note. On January 22, 2014 the
Company entered into a Mutual Release (the “Release”) with IBC pursuant to which each party would release the other
party from any and all obligations pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. In consideration for the Release, IBC accepted and the
Company remitted to IBC: (i) a cash payment of $190,000, (ii) an issuance of 9,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock,

not engage in any off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, revenues, and results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures. Significant Accounting Policies Research and Development Costs The Company expenses
all research and development costs as incurred. Until we have developed a commercial product, all costs incurred in connection
with the SRA with the University, as well as all other research and development costs incurred, will be expensed as incurred. After
a commercial product has been developed, we will report costs incurred in producing products for sale as assets, but we will continue
to expense costs incurred for further product research and development activities. Stock-Based Compensation Since its inception 3DIcon
has used its common stock or warrants to purchase its common stock as a means of compensating our employees and consultants. Financial
Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") guidance on accounting for share based payments requires us to estimate the value
of securities used for compensation and to charge such amounts to expense over the periods benefited. The estimated fair value
at date of grant of options for our common stock is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, as follows: 30 The expected dividend
yield is based on the average annual dividend yield as of the grant date. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility
of our stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity rates as of the grant date. The expected
life of the option is based on historical exercise behavior and expected future experience. Subsequent Events Common stock issued for services and liabilities Subsequent to December
