 DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OR PLAN OF OPERATION. The following is management’s discussion
and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods
included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, as well as information relating to the plans of our current management.
This report includes forward-looking statements. Generally, the words “believes,” “anticipates,” “may,”
“will,” “should,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “continue,”
and similar expressions or the negative thereof or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including the matters set forth in this report or other reports
or documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, which could cause actual results or outcomes
to differ materially from those projected. Undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements which speak
only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. The following discussion and analysis of our
financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto for
the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. The independent auditor’s reports on
our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 includes a “going concern” explanatory paragraph
that describes substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to the factors
prompting the explanatory paragraph are discussed below and also in Note 11 to the audited consolidated financial statements. 15 While our financial statements are presented
on the basis that we are a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the
normal course of business over a reasonable length of time, our auditor’s have raised substantial doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern. (a) Liquidity
and Capital Resources For the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash
used in operating activities was $153,987 compared to $239,887 for the year ended December 31, 2013. The company had a net loss
$139,558 for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to a net loss of $692,050 for the year ended December 31, 2013. Negative
cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2014 was a result of the net loss and a net increase in operating assets and liabilities
of $8,846 and by the gain on marketable securities of $7,054. The 2013 net loss was impacted by non-cash expenses of stock and
option compensation expense of $393,250. The stock-based compensation expense is comprised of the vesting of options to purchase
700,000 shares of common stock, valued at $147,000, the issuance of 900,000 shares of common stock for patent rights resulting
in stock based compensation of $225,000 and the amortization of $21,250 prepaid stock compensation for consulting services. Also
included in cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2013, was the non-cash amortization of deferred equity consideration
for customer acquisition costs of $72,917 as a result of the issuance of 500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock pursuant
to the initial one year term of the Assignment Agreement. Additional non-cash expenses for the year ended December, 2013 were the
amortization of the initial discount of $22,465 on the convertible note. These non-cash add-backs were partially offset by a gain
recorded on the sale of marketable securities of $67,840 and the change in the fair value of derivative liabilities of $8,298. During the year ended December 31, 2014, net
cash used in investing activities was $54,737, comprised of $75,541 advanced in exchange for a note receivable and payment of security
deposits of $700, reduced by receipts of $16,554 from the sale of marketable securities and repayments of $4,950 on the note receivable.
Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $130,959 as a result of $134,388 received from
the sale of marketable securities less the purchase of office furniture of $1,929 and the payments related to patent costs of $1,450. During the year ended December 31, 2014, net
cash provided by financing activities was $208,313 compared to $72,222 for the year ended December 31, 2013. The 2014 amount was
comprised of a repayment of $7,000 on the convertible note and increases of $215,313 in amounts due shareholders for services provided
to the Company and expenses paid for the Company. The 2013 financing activity was comprised of repayments of $43,000 on the convertible
note and an increase of $115,222 in amounts due shareholders for services provided and expenses for the Company. For the year ended December 31, 2014, cash
and cash equivalents decreased by $411 compared to a decrease of $36,706 for the year ended December 31, 2013. Ending cash and
cash equivalents at December 31, 2014 was $3,501 compared to $3,912 at December 31, 2013. The Company has limited cash and cash equivalents
on hand. The Company maintains its’ daily operations and capital needs through revenue from our marketing of credit processing
services by way of fees we receive from merchant payment processing service providers on whose behalf we broker their processing
services, as well as from the sale of marketable securities the Company owns. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company
sold 50,000 shares of Agritek common stock it owned and realized proceeds of approximately $16,554 from the sales. In addition to marketing credit card processing
services, the Company also has developed on-line portals and mobile applications offering directories of professional service providers.
The Company has completed its’ initial on-line portal and mobile application dedicated to a directory of medical doctors,
however the Company has not commenced revenue producing operations by way of the medical directory. The Company intends to maintain
its 800 short code and platform, which will be used to run its medical portal and service other developments. We will need to raise funds to continue to
be able to support our operating expenses and to meet our other obligations as they become due. Sources available to us that we
may utilize include the sale of unsecured convertible debentures from unaffiliated investors which may cause dilution to our stockholders. 16 (b) Results of Operations Results of operations for the year ended

growth company” under the 2012 JOBS Act. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage
of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting
standards. As an emerging growth company, we can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would
otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. Accounts Receivable The Company records accounts receivable from
amounts due from its processors. The Company charges certain merchants for processing services at a bundled rate based on a percentage
of the dollar amount of each transaction and, in some instances, additional fees are charged for each transaction. The Company
charges other merchant customers a flat fee per transaction, and may also charge miscellaneous fees to customers, including fees
for returns, monthly minimums, and other miscellaneous services. All the charges and collections thereon flow through processors
who then remit the fee due the Company within the month following the actual charges. Marketable Securities The Company classifies its marketable securities
as available-for-sale securities, which are carried at their fair value based on the quoted market prices of the securities with
unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred income taxes, reported as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate
component of stockholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included in net earnings
in the period earned or incurred. Patents The Company capitalizes patent pending acquisition
costs, legal fees and filing costs associated with the development and filing of its patents. Patents are generally
amortized over an estimated useful life of 15 years using the straight-line method beginning on the issue date. No
amortization expense was recorded during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, as the Company’s patents are still pending
as of December 31, 2014. 19 Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue in accordance
with FASB ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. ASC 605 requires that four basic criteria are met (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, (2) delivery of products and services has occurred, (3) the fee is fixed or determinable and (4) collectability is reasonably
assured. The Company recognizes revenue during the month in which commissions are earned. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair value measurements are determined under
a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value,
distinguishing between market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting
entity (“observable inputs”) and the reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions
developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (“unobservable inputs”). Fair value is the price
that would be received to sell an asset or would be paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the “exit price”) in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the Company primarily uses prices and
other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets (“market approach”).
The Company also considers the impact of a significant decrease in volume and level of activity for an asset or liability when
compared with normal activity to identify transactions that are not orderly. The highest priority is given to unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level
3 measurements). Securities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair
value measurement. The three hierarchy levels are defined
as follows: Level 1 – Quoted prices
in active markets that is unadjusted and accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities; Level 2 – Quoted prices
for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active
markets or financial instruments for which significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly; Level 3 – Prices or valuations
that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. Credit risk adjustments are applied to reflect
the Company’s own credit risk when valuing all liabilities measured at fair value. The methodology is consistent with that
applied in developing counterparty credit risk adjustments, but incorporates the Company’s own credit risk as observed in
the credit default swap market. The Company's financial instruments consist
primarily of marketable securities. Marketable securities are adjusted to fair value each balance sheet date, based on quoted prices;
which are considered level 1 inputs (see Note 5). The estimated fair value is not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company
would realize in a current market exchange or from future earnings or cash flows. The Company’s derivative liability resulting
from the issuance of convertible debt is adjusted to fair value based on recent sales of the underlying common stock and the use
of an option pricing model, which are consistent with level 3 inputs. See Note 6. 20 The following table represents the Company’s
financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 for each
fair value hierarchy level: The following table represents the Company’s
financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 for each
fair value hierarchy level: Derivative Marketable December 31, 2014 Liability Securities Total Level I $ — $ 30,000 $ 30,000 Level II $ — $ — $ Level III $ — $ — $ December 31, 2013 Level I $ — $ 72,150 $ 72,150 Level II $ — $ — $ Level III $ 6,373 $ — $ 6,373 Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance
with ASC 740-10, Income Taxes. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the estimated future tax effects,
calculated at the tax rate expected to be in effect at the time of realization. The Company records a valuation allowance related
to a deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of the changes in tax laws and rates of the date of enactment. ASC 740-10 prescribes a recognition threshold
that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements and provides guidance on recognition,
measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition issues. The Company
classifies interest and penalties as a component of interest and other expenses. To date, the Company has not been assessed, nor
has the Company paid, any interest or penalties. The Company measures and records uncertain
tax positions by establishing a threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected
to be taken in a tax return. Only tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date may
be recognized or continue to be recognized. The Company’s tax years subsequent to 2010 remain subject to examination by federal
and state tax jurisdictions. Earnings (Loss) Per Share The Company reports earnings (loss) per share
in accordance with ASC 260, "Earnings per Share." Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income
(loss), after deducting preferred stock dividends accumulated during the period, by the weighted-average number of shares of common
stock outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number
of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and other potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Potentially
dilutive securities for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 included options to purchase 1,600,000 shares of common stock,
which were not included in the calculation of diluted loss per share because their impact was anti-dilutive. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for stock awards issued
to non-employees in accordance with ASC 505-50, Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees. The measurement date is the earlier of
(1) the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached, or (2) the date
at which the counterparty's performance is complete. Stock awards granted to non-employees are valued at their respective measurement
dates based on the trading price of the Company’s common stock and recognized as expense during the period in which services
are provided. 21 Comprehensive Income The Company has adopted ASC Topic 220, "Comprehensive
Income." This statement establishes standards for reporting comprehensive income and its components in a financial statement.
Comprehensive income as defined includes all changes in equity (net assets) during a period from non-owner sources. Items included
in the Company’s comprehensive loss consist of unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities. ITEM 7A
