NOTE ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS The
information contained in this Report includes some statements that are not purely historical and that are “forward-looking
statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”),
and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and as such, may involve
risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements relate to, among other things, expectations of the business environment
in which we operate, perceived opportunities in the market and statements regarding our mission and vision. In addition, any statements
that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions,
are forward-looking statements. You can generally identify forward-looking statements as statements containing the words “anticipates,”
“believes,” “continue,” “could,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,”
“may,” “might,” “plans,” “possible,” “potential,” “predicts,”
“projects,” “seeks,” “should,” “will,” “would” and similar expressions,
or the negatives of such terms, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking
statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed
in the forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained herein are based on various assumptions, many of which
are based, in turn, upon further assumptions. Our expectations, beliefs and forward-looking statements are expressed in good faith
on the basis of management’s views and assumptions as of the time the statements are made, but there can be no assurance
that management’s expectations, beliefs or projections will result or be achieved or accomplished. In
addition to other factors and matters discussed elsewhere herein, the following are important factors that, in our view, could
cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements: technological advances, impact
of competition, dependence on key personnel and the need to attract new management, effectiveness of cost and marketing efforts,
acceptances of products, ability to expand markets and the availability of capital or other funding on terms satisfactory to us.
We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof. For
a discussion of the risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could affect our future events, developments or results, you should
carefully review the “Risk Factors” set forth under “Item 1. Description of Business” below. In light
of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the future events, developments or results described by our forward-looking statements
herein could turn to be materially different from those we discuss or imply. PART
I Item
1. Description of Business. History
and Development of the Company 2050
Motors, Inc. has an exclusive license, subject to minimum sales requirements, to import, market and sell in the United States,
Puerto Rico, the US Territories and Peru, the “e-Go” lightweight carbon fiber all-electric vehicle design and electric
light truck, manufactured by Jiangsu Aoxin New Energy Automobile Co., Ltd. (“Aoxin Automobile”) located in the People’s
Republic of China (“PRC”). Aoxin Automobile was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dongfeng Motor Corporation (“Dongfeng
Motor”), which is one of the largest automobile manufacturers in China, producing over 3.76 million cars and trucks in 2012.
Aoxin Automobile was funded by Dongfeng Motor to develop and manufacture a lightweight, super-efficient, carbon fiber e-Go EV
electric car (“e-Go EV”). Dongfeng Motor, over a five year period, invested a substantial amount of money to develop
with the support of Italian engineers a new carbon fiber technology to produce carbon fiber parts at a significantly reduced cost.
They also developed a lightweight aluminum racing frame to ultimately create the ultralight weight electric automobile known as
the e-Go. In
2014, Yancheng Municipal State-Owned Asset Investment Group, Co. Ltd. (YMSIG), an investment and property development company
founded by the Yancheng Municipal Government, purchased Aoxin Automobile from Dongfeng Motor, Co. Ltd. YMSIG has made major investments
in Aoxin, which funded on a fast track schedule the completion of the e-Go automobile manufacturing facility that culminated in
a grand opening ceremony on January 20, 2015. The
e-Go EV is a unique lightweight carbon fiber electric vehicle built on an aluminum frame. It will be the only production line
electric vehicle with a carbon fiber body manufactured by a new process that uses robotics to produce parts, which significantly
reduces the production time and cost of carbon fiber components. The carbon fiber composite material is five times stronger than
steel, and one third the weight. In
accordance with the exclusive license agreement signed with Aoxin Automobile, in order to maintain exclusive rights for the United
States (USA), the Company is required to purchase and sell a certain amount of e-Go EV model vehicles per year for a certain period
of time starting from the completion of the requirements established by the United States Department of Transportation’s (US DOT) protocols for the e-Go EV model. The required amount of vehicles that the
company needs to sell per year are as follows: Year one-2,000 vehicles; Year 2-6,000 vehicles; Year 3-12,000 vehicles; Year 4-24,000
vehicles and Year 5-48,000 vehicles. 3 The
exclusive license contract between 2050 Motors and Aoxin Automobile requires that 2050 Motors complete US crash testing according
to US Department of Transportation (“US DOT”) safety standards. 2050 Motors has entered into negotiations with the
Calspan Corporation (“Calspan”). Calspan is committed to the evolution of safety in the air and on the ground, and
has assisted in developing new aircraft; training world-class test pilots; performing ground-breaking automobile accident research;
and contributing to safety innovations on the ground and in the air over its 70-year history. Calspan has performed over 40,000
sled test operations for aircraft and 2,500 full-scale crash tests conducted on behalf of the US
DOT. Three
demonstration vehicles will be shipped to the United States by June 2015 built from Aoxin’s new e-Go Production Plant completed
in January 2015. 2050 Motors intends to eventually
crash test eight (8) e-Go EV vehicles by the end of 2015. However, before this is done, design of the airbags must also be completed
by Aoxin Automobile. Aoxin is currently designing an airbag system for the e-Go EV however 2050 Motors cannot predict at this
time whether the airbag system will suffice for the US market and/or may require additional airbags for successful crash testing.
In addition, Aoxin Automobile has stated that the e-Go EV will be equipped with US DOT approved parts and equipment; these are,
windshield, tires, breaking system, etc. 2050 Motors does not know at the present time if all the equipment on the e-Go EV will
be DOT compliant, and 2050 Motors may or may not have to re-equip the parts, if any, either in China or the United States. During
the year 2013, both the engineers in the United States and in China collaborated on many aspects of the e-Go EV to meet or surpass
the US standards. These modifications have been incorporated into the e-Go EV. One of these modifications was to specifically
address a new crash test which is not yet required in the United States. This test, created by the leading insurance industry
group IIHS, is called the overlap test which insurance companies are trying to adopt into the standard automobile crash test program.
The crash test consists of a vehicle to be submitted under new safety standards for front-end collisions in which 25% of the front
end, on the driver’s side, strikes a 5-foot-tall barrier at 40 mph. The overlap test has proven to be very difficult for
present automobiles on the road to pass. In fact, thirteen automobiles produced by the top end manufacturers such as Mercedes,
Audi, etc., have either failed or done very poorly in this crash test sequence. 2050
Motors intends to import all vehicles completely fabricated and assembled in China from Aoxin Automobile. 2050 Motors will market
the e-Go EV vehicles in designated markets and is not expected to need any raw materials, components or equipment, except spare
parts which will be supplied by Aoxin Automobile. However, the e-Go EV and all of its parts and equipment must be DOT approved.
After the demonstration vehicles are delivered to the USA, some of the existing parts of the e-Go EV may or may not meet DOT specifications.
Aoxin Automobile has made every effort to build the e-Go EV according to American standards. However, there is no certainty that
all the parts will be DOT approved. 2050 Motors may elect to secure replacement parts here in the USA or in China for installation
either in the United States or in China, if required. 2050
Motors intends to initially sell the e-Go EV to a network of customers primarily in the Las Vegas, Nevada area. 2050 Motors plans
to establish a service and parts center, which would be separate from the Showroom. The Showroom facility will be at an area with
high volume of people in Las Vegas, where visitors to the city can directly view the e-Go EV. 2050 Motors may also elect to sell
the e-Go EV at selected distributors in the Las Vegas Area, which have already provided letters of interest to sell our vehicles.
2050 Motors’ initial plan is not to sell the vehicle outside of the Las Vegas vicinity, consisting of an area within a radius
of 100 miles. In the metropolitan area of Las Vegas the population is approximately
1.9 million people. This is the Company’s current marketing plan in order to effectively market to and support people that
work and/or live in Las Vegas. 2050
Motors is a development stage company with no operating history and may never be able to carry out our business plan or achieve
any revenues or profitability. 2050 Motors was established in October 2012 and it has not generated any revenues nor have we realized
a profit from our operations to date, and there is little likelihood that we will generate any revenues or realize any profits
in the short term. Any profitability in the future from its business will be dependent upon the successful marketing and sales
of the e-Go EV. 2050 Motors may not be able to successfully carry out its business plan. There can be no assurance that it will
ever achieve any revenues or profitability. Accordingly, its prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses, and
difficulties frequently encountered in establishing a new business, especially one in the automobile industry, and therefore it
is a highly speculative venture involving significant financial risk. We
are completely dependent on Aoxin Automobile to supply us with the e-Go EV and other trucks and automobiles and parts and components
thereto. The inability of Aoxin Automobile to continue to deliver, or their refusal to deliver such vehicles and parts at prices
and volumes acceptable to us would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects and operating results. Changes in
business conditions, global financial instability, wars, governmental changes, and other factors beyond our control or which we
do not presently anticipate, could also affect Aoxin Automobile’s ability to deliver vehicles and/or parts on a timely basis
and cause material adverse consequences to 2050 Motors. 2050
Motors has signed an exclusive Agreement with Aoxin Automobile for the sale of these vehicles in the United States. Phase I. Phase
II will involve assembly of these vehicles in the United States, creating hundreds of American jobs after all State and Federal
Standards and requirements have been met. Phase III, assembly and manufacturing of the complete vehicle in the United States,
will occur after an established market is created in Phase I and Phase II, creating upwards of a thousand US jobs for each manufacturing
facility. 4 Research
by Aoxin Automobile over the past five years developed this advanced all-electric vehicle. The e-Go EV is a five passenger sedan
which weighs only 1,450 lbs with its battery pack included. It will be the first vehicle of this advanced type to be sold in the
price range of less than $35,000. The
body components are built out of carbon fiber which is five times stronger than steel and one third its weight constructed over
a strong ultralight aluminum frame chassis and race car suspension. This ensures that the vehicle will be the safest and strongest
ever built for the consumer market. It will also be the most efficient vehicle ever built, capable of achieving 150+ miles to
the gallon energy equivalent. Item
1A. Risk Factors An
investment in our securities is highly speculative and subject to numerous and substantial risks. Readers are encouraged to review
these risks carefully before making any investment decision. Risk
Factors Affecting Future Operating Results As
the business of 2050 Motors will now become the primary business of the Company, the following risk factors relate to 2050 Motors
and its business. 2050
Motors is a development company with limited operating history which makes the evaluation of its future business prospects difficult. You
should consider, among other factors, our prospects for success in light of the risks and uncertainties encountered by companies
that, like us, have a limited operating history. We may not successfully address these risks and uncertainties or successfully
market our proposed new products. If we fail to do so, it could materially harm our business and impair the value of our common
stock. Even if we accomplish these objectives, we may not generate the positive cash flows or profits we anticipate in the future.
2050 Motors, which is our only operating business, was incorporated in Nevada on November 12, 2012 and has generated no revenue
to date. Since its inception its principal activities have been the design of its business plan and the development, with third
parties, of a new and improved electric vehicle. Unanticipated problems, expenses and delays are frequently encountered in establishing
and developing new products, especially in the automobile industry. These include, but are not limited to, inadequate funding,
lack of consumer acceptance, competition, product development, and inadequate sales and marketing. The failure by us to meet any
of these conditions would have a materially adverse effect upon us and may force us to reduce or curtail operations. No assurance
can be given that we can or will ever operate profitably. If
we are unable to meet our future capital needs, we may be required to reduce or curtail operations. To
date, we have relied on funding from investors, our officers and directors, and close associates to fund operations. To date,
we have not generated any revenue and have extremely limited cash liquidity and capital resources. Our future capital requirements
will depend on many factors, including our ability to market our products successfully, cash flow from operations, and our ability
to obtain financing in the capital markets. Our business plan requires additional funding beyond our anticipated cash flow from
operations. Consequently, although we currently have no specific plans or arrangements for financing, we intend to raise funds
through private placements, public offerings or other financing. Any equity financing would result in dilution to our then-existing
stockholders. Sources of debt financing may result in higher interest expense and may expose the Company to liquidity problems.
Any financing, if available, may be on unfavorable terms. If adequate funds are not obtained, we may be required to reduce or
curtail operations. We anticipate that our existing capital resources will be adequate to satisfy our operating expenses and capital
requirements for approximately 6 months. However, this estimate of expenses and capital requirements may prove to be inaccurate. Our
business will depend on certain key 2050 Motors personnel, the loss of which would adversely affect our chances of success. 2050
Motors’ success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of its senior management, key executives and
consultants. We do not have “key person” life insurance policies on or any employment agreement with any of our officers
or other employees. The loss of the services of any of the key members of senior management, other key personnel or consultants,
or our inability to retain high quality subcontractors or personnel may have materially adverse effects on our business and operating
results. Our
future growth is dependent upon consumers’ willingness to accept electric vehicles. Our
growth is highly dependent upon the adoption by consumers of, and we are subject to an elevated risk of any reduced demand for,
alternative fuel vehicles, generally, and electric vehicles in particular. If consumers do not adopt electric vehicles, our business,
prospects, financial condition and operating results will be harmed. The market for alternative fuel vehicles is relatively new,
rapidly evolving, characterized by rapidly changing technologies, price competition, additional competitors, evolving government
regulation and industry standards, frequent new vehicle announcements and changing consumer demands and behaviors. Developments
in alternative technologies or improvements in the internal combustion engine may materially adversely affect the demand for our
electric vehicles. Significant developments in alternative technologies, such as advanced diesel, ethanol, fuel cells or compressed
natural gas, or improvements in the fuel economy of the internal combustion engine, may materially and adversely affect our business
and prospects in ways we cannot anticipate. Any failure by us and our manufacturer to develop new or enhanced technologies or
processes, or to react to changes in existing technologies, could materially delay our development and introduction of new and
enhanced electric vehicles, which could result in the loss of competitiveness of our vehicles, decreased revenue and a loss of
market share to competitors. 5 The
automotive market is highly competitive, and we may not be successful in competing in this industry. We currently face competition
from established competitors and expect to face competition from others in the future. The
worldwide automotive market, particularly for alternative fuel vehicles, is highly competitive today and we expect it will become
even more so in the future. In 2009, no other mass produced performance highway capable electric vehicles were being sold in the
United States or Europe. By December 2014, just five years later, there are many companies selling mass produced electric vehicles.
We expect greater significant competition, as more competitors enter these markets within the next several years. Almost
all of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing and other resources
than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale
and support of their products. Virtually all of our competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer and industry
relationships than we do. In addition, almost all of these companies have longer operating histories and greater name recognition
than we do. Our competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new technologies and may be able to design, develop,
market and sell their products more effectively. Furthermore,
certain large manufacturers offer financing and leasing options on their vehicles and also have the ability to market vehicles
at a substantial discount, provided that the vehicles are financed through their affiliated financing company. We do not currently
offer discounts or leasing options on our vehicles, which may put our vehicles at a competitive disadvantage. If
our vehicles fail to perform as expected, our ability to develop, market and sell our electric vehicles could be harmed. Our
vehicles may contain defects in design and manufacture that may cause them not to perform as expected or that may require repair.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defects in the vehicles prior to their sale to consumers.
Any product defects or any other failure of our performance electric vehicles to perform as expected could harm our reputation
and result in adverse publicity, lost revenue, delivery delays, product recalls, product liability claims, harm to our brand and
reputation, and significant warranty and other expenses, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition,
operating results and prospects. If
we are unable to address the service requirements of our existing and future customers our business will be materially and adversely
affected. If
we are unable to successfully address the service requirements of our existing and future customers our business and prospects
will be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we anticipate the level and quality of the service that we will provide
our customers will have a direct impact on the success of our vehicles. If we are unable to satisfactorily service our customers,
our ability to generate customer loyalty, grow our business and sell additional electric vehicles would be greatly impaired. Although
we have many years of experience working with electric vehicles, we have no direct experience servicing the e-Go EV vehicles.
Aoxin Automobile has not yet begun production of our automobiles. We expect to receive three demonstration electric vehicles from
Aoxin’s new Manufacturing Plant. Servicing electric vehicles is different than
servicing vehicles with internal combustion engines and requires specialized skills, including high voltage training and servicing
techniques. We
plan to service our performance electric vehicles through our company-owned stores. As of the date hereof, we have only one company
owned store located in Las Vegas, Nevada. As we grow, we will need to open additional stores with service capabilities, as well
as hire and train significant numbers of new employees to staff these centers. There can be no assurance that these service arrangements
will adequately address the service requirements of our customers to their satisfaction, or that we will have sufficient resources
to meet these service requirement in a timely manner as the volume of vehicles we are able to deliver annually increases. We
are dependent upon our relationship with Aoxin Automobile for the manufacturing of the e-Go EV automobile. In
July 2013, we entered into a distribution agreement with Aoxin Automobile pursuant to which Aoxin Automobile agreed to assist
with the design and manufacture of the e-Go EV automobile. Pursuant to the distribution agreement with Aoxion, in order to maintain
our exclusive distribution rights, we are obligated to purchase a minimum of 2,000 fully assembled automobiles in the first year (beginning at the time of approval from the US DOT, State and Federal standards and requirements,
and completion of crash testing according to US protocol), which doubles each year thereafter until year five when the
minimum purchase is 48,000 automobiles. If we are unable to meet this volume requirement, our exclusive distribution rights revert
to non-exclusive rights. Additionally, because we are dependent upon our relationship with Aoxin Automobile for the manufacturing
of the e-Go EV automobile, our business depends on Aoxin continuing to operate as a viable and solvent entity and to continue
to produce the e-Go EV vehicles pursuant to our agreement. Any delay or discontinuance by Aoxin of delivery of the e-Go EV vehicles
and or failure by Aoxin to produce the vehicles in accordance with quality standards would have a material adverse effect on our
business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. 6 The
unavailability, reduction or elimination of government and economic incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, operating results and prospects. Any
reduction, elimination or discriminatory application of government subsidies and economic incentives because of policy changes,
the reduced need for such subsidies and incentives due to the perceived success of the electric vehicle, fiscal tightening or
other reasons may result in the diminished competitiveness of the alternative fuel vehicle industry generally or our electric
vehicles in particular. This could materially and adversely affect the growth of the alternative fuel automobile markets and our
business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Our growth depends in part on the availability and amounts of
government subsidies and economic incentives for alternative fuel vehicles generally and performance electric vehicles specifically.
In addition, certain regulations that encourage sales of electric cars could be reduced, eliminated or applied in a way that creates
an adverse effect against our vehicles, either currently or at any time in the future. 2050
Motors stockholders will be able to control the Company. As
a result of the Reorganization, the initial stockholders of 2050 Motors were issued common stock of the Company representing 82%
of the Company’s outstanding common stock. Accordingly, Mr. Hu and other former 2050 Motors stockholders will have the ability
to control the affairs of the Company for the foreseeable future. Inadequate
market liquidity may make it difficult to sell our stock. There
is currently a limited public market for our common stock, but we can give no assurance that there will always be such a market.
Only a limited number of shares of our common stock are actively traded in the public market and we cannot give assurance that
the market for our stock will develop sufficiently to create significant market liquidity and stable market prices. An investor
may find it difficult or impossible to sell shares of our common stock in the public market because of the limited number of potential
buyers at any time or because of fluctuations in our market price. In addition, the shares of our common stock are not eligible
as a margin security and lending institutions may not accept our common stock as collateral for a loan. We
have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the future. Any return on investment may be limited
to the value of our common stock. We
have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends
on our common stock will depend on earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting us at such
time as our board of directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because
a return on your investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates. There
is a limited trading market for our common stock and if a market for our common stock does not further develop, our investors
may be unable to sell their shares in a timely manner. Although
we are trading on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol “ETFM”, there is currently no active trading market for
our common stock and such a market may not develop or be sustained. If an active trading market is established for our common
stock, the market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by factors such as actual or anticipated fluctuations
in our operating results, general market conditions and other factors. In addition, the stock market has from time to time experienced
significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of the shares of companies like 2050
Motors, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock in a material manner. The
regulation of “Penny” stocks by the SEC and FINRA may discourage the tradability of our common stock. We
are a “penny stock” company. Our securities are subject to a Securities and Exchange Commission rule that imposes
special sales practice requirements upon broker-dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers or
accredited investors. For purposes of the rule, the phrase “accredited investors” means, in general terms, institutions
with assets in excess of $5,000,000, or individuals having a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or having an annual income that
exceeds $200,000 (or that, when combined with a spouse’s income, exceeds $300,000). For transactions covered by the rule,
the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement
to the transaction prior to the sale. Effectively, this discourages broker-dealers from executing trades in penny stocks. Consequently,
the rule will affect the ability of purchasers in this offering to sell their securities in any market that might develop therefore
because it imposes additional regulatory burdens on penny stock transactions. In
addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted a number of rules to regulate “penny stocks”. Such rules
include Rules 3a51-1, 15g-1, 15g-2, 15g-3, 15g-4, 15g-5, 15g-6, 15g-7, and 15g-9 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended. Because our securities constitute “penny stocks” within the meaning of the rules, the rules would apply
to us and to our securities. The rules will further affect the ability of owners of shares to sell our securities in any market
that might develop for them because it imposes additional regulatory burdens on penny stock transactions. Shareholders
should be aware that, according to Securities and Exchange Commission, the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years
from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include (i) control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers
that are often related to the promoter or issuer; (ii) manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales
and false and misleading press releases; (iii) “boiler room” practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic
price projections by inexperienced sales persons; (iv) excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differentials and markups by selling
broker-dealers; and (v) the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated
to a desired consequent shareholder losses. Our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny
stock market. 7 Item

Information Market
Information There
has only been limited trading for the Company’s Common Stock over the past ten years. There is no assurance that an active
trading market will ever develop or, if such a market does develop, that it will continue. The Securities and Exchange Commission
has adopted Rule 15g-9 which establishes the definition of a “penny stock,” for purposes relevant to the Company,
as any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share,
subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require: (i) that a broker
or dealer approve a person’s account for transactions in penny stocks and (ii) the broker or dealer receive from the investor
a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased. In order to
approve a person’s account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must (i) obtain financial information
and investment experience and objectives of the person and (ii) make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny
stocks are suitable for that person and that person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable
of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks. The broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a
penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the Commission relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form, (i)
sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination and (ii) that the broker or dealer received
a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction. Disclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing
in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading, and about commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and
the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases
of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the
penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. Holders There
are approximately 305 holders of the Company’s Common Stock. This figure does not include holders of shares registered in
“street name” or persons, partnerships, associates, corporations or other entities identified in security position
listings maintained by depositories. Dividends We
have not declared any cash dividends on our common stock since our inception and do not anticipate paying any dividends in the
foreseeable future. We plan to retain future earnings, if any, for use in our business. Any decisions as to future payments of
dividends will depend on our earnings and financial position and such other facts, as the Board of Directors deems relevant. Securities
Authorized under Equity Compensation Plans We
do not have any equity compensation plans. Shares
Available for Future Sale Approximately
90% of all outstanding shares of our common stock are “restricted securities,” as that term is defined under Rule
144 promulgated under the Securities Act, because they were issued in a private transaction not involving a public offering. Accordingly,
none of the outstanding shares of our common stock may be resold, transferred, pledged as collateral or otherwise disposed of
unless such transaction is registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from registration is available. In connection with
any transfer of shares of our common stock other than pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act,
the Company may require the holder to provide to the Company an opinion of counsel to the effect that such transfer does not require
registration of such transferred shares under the Securities Act. Rule
144 is not available for the resale of securities initially issued by companies that are, or previously were, shell companies,
like us, unless the following conditions are met: ● the issuer of the securities that was formerly a shell company has ceased to be a shell company; ● the issuer of the securities is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act; ● the issuer of the securities has filed all Exchange Act reports and material required to be filed, as applicable, during the preceding 12 months (or such shorter period that the issuer was required to file such reports and materials), other than Current Reports on Form 8-K; and ● at least one year has elapsed from the time that the issuer filed current comprehensive disclosure with the SEC reflecting its status as an entity that is not a shell company. 9 In
view of the above, shareholders may utilize Rule 144 for the sale of their shares on or about May 10, 2015, assuming all of the
other requirements set forth above are met. Repurchases
of Equity Securities None Our
common stock is approved for quotation on the OTC Markets’ OTCQB marketplace under the symbol “ETFM”. The OTC
QB is a regulated quotation service that displays real-time quotes, last-sale prices, and volume information in over-the-counter
equity securities. The OTC QB securities are traded by a community of market makers that enter quotes and trade reports. This
market is limited in comparison to the national stock exchanges and any prices quoted may not be a reliable indication of the
value of our common stock. On
March 27, 2015, the closing price of our common stock reported on the OTCQB was $1.66 per share. The following table sets forth,
for each of the quarterly periods indicated, the high and low sales prices of our common stock, as reported on the OTCQB. High Bid Low Bid Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2012 Quarter Ended March 31, 2012 $ .03 $ .03 Quarter Ended June 30, 2012 $ .03 $ .03 Quarter Ended September 30, 2012 $ .03 $ .03 Quarter Ended December 31, 2012 $ .08 $ .03 Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2013 Quarter Ended March 31, 2013 $ .05 $ .04 Quarter Ended June 30, 2013 $ .20 $ .05 Quarter Ended September 30, 2013 $ .15 $ .04 Quarter Ended December 31, 2013 $ .10 $ .06 Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2014 Quarter Ended March 31, 2014 $ 1.79 $ .06 Quarter Ended June 30, 2014 $ 4.40 $ .51 Quarter Ended September 30, 2014 $ 1.24 $ .80 Quarter Ended December 31, 2014 $ 3.00 $ 1.01 Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2015 January 1 thru March 27, 2015 $ 2.45 $ 1.01 Penny
Stock Considerations The
trading of our common stock is deemed to be “penny stock” as that term is generally defined in the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 to mean equity securities with a price of less than $5.00. Our shares thus are subject to rules that impose sales
practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who engage in certain transactions involving a penny stock. Under
the penny stock regulations, a broker-dealer selling a penny stock to anyone other than an established customer or accredited
investor must make a special suitability determination regarding the purchaser and must receive the purchaser’s written
consent to the transaction prior to the sale, unless the broker-dealer is otherwise exempt. Generally, an individual with a net
worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $100,000 individually or $300,000 together with his or her spouse is
considered an accredited investor. In addition, under the penny stock regulations the broker-dealer is required to: Deliver, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt; Disclose commissions payable to the broker-dealer and our registered representatives and current bid and offer quotations for the securities; Send monthly statements disclosing recent price information pertaining to the penny stock held in a customer’s account, the account’s value and information regarding the limited market in penny stocks; and Make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction, prior to conducting any penny stock transaction in the customer’s account. Because
of these regulations, broker-dealers may encounter difficulties in their attempt to buy or sell shares of our common stock, which
may affect the ability of selling stockholders or other holders to sell their shares in the secondary market and have the effect
of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market. These additional sales practice and disclosure requirements
could impede the sale of our common stock in the market place. In addition, the liquidity for our common stock may be decreased,
with a corresponding decrease in the price of our common stock. Our shares are likely to be subject to such penny stock rules
for the foreseeable future. 10 Reports
to Stockholders We
are currently subject to the information and reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and will continue to
file periodic reports, and other information with the SEC. We intend to send annual reports to our stockholders containing audited
financial statements. Transfer
Agent Signature,
Stock Transfer, Inc., located at 2632 Coachlight Court, Plano, Texas 75093 is the registrar and transfer agent for our common
stock. Recent
Sales of Unregistered Securities Between
July 7 and December 1, 2014, the Registrant sold 2,721,146 shares of its common stock to 21 “accredited” investors
for an aggregate purchase amount of $955,400. During
the year ended December 31, 2014, the Registrant issued 62,072 shares of its common stock to two consultants for services rendered
valued at $51,771. All
of the issuances by us of our unregistered securities were made in reliance upon Regulation D and Section 4(2) of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”). The entities or individuals listed above that purchased the unregistered
securities were known to us and our management, through pre-existing business relationships. They were provided access to all
material information, all information necessary to verify such information, and our management in connection with the purchases.
The purchaser of the unregistered securities acquired such securities for investment and not with a view toward distribution,
acknowledging such intent to us. All certificates or agreements representing such securities that were issued contained restrictive
legends, prohibiting further transfer of the certificates or agreements representing such securities, without such securities
either being first registered or otherwise exempt from registration in any further resale or disposition. Additional
Information We
are a fully reporting issuer, subject to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our Quarterly Reports, Annual Reports, and other
filings can be obtained from the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE., Washington, DC 20549, on official business
days during the hours of 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. You may also obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling

general economic conditions and changes in the assumptions used in making such forward-looking statements. The following discussion
and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the audited consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. The analysis set forth
below is provided pursuant to applicable Securities and Exchange Commission regulations and is not intended to serve as a basis
for projections of future events. Refer also to “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking
Statements” in Item 1 above. 11 Plan
of Operation Prior
to the completion of the acquisition of 2050 Motors, Inc., a Nevada corporation, (“2050 Motors”) on May 2, 2014, the
Company was a public “shell” company with nominal assets whose sole business was to identify, evaluate, and investigate
various companies to acquire or with which to merge. Upon consummation of the transaction with 2050 Motors, the Company’s
business became the business of 2050 Motors, which is the Company’s sole operating subsidiary. Our principal business objective
for the next 12 months will be to achieve long-term growth through 2050 Motors. The
Company completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of 2050 Motors on May 2, 2014. The acquisition
was effected pursuant to the terms of a Plan and Agreement of Reorganization (the “Agreement”) entered into on February
5, 2014, by and between the Company, 2050 Motors and Certain Shareholders of 2050 Motors. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement,
the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of 2050 Motors in exchange for 24,994,670post-split shares
of the Company’s common stock (aggregating approximately 82% of its issued and outstanding common stock). 2050
Motors principal activity is the importation and the marketing and selling of electric automobiles. 2050 Motors, Inc. has an exclusive
license, subject to minimum sales requirements, to import, market and sell in the United States, Puerto Rico, the US Territories
and Peru, the “e-Go” lightweight carbon fiber all-electric vehicle design and electric light truck, manufactured by
Jiangsu Aoxin New Energy Automobile Co., LTD (“Aoxin Automobile”) located in the Peoples Republic of China (“PRC”).
Aoxin Automobile is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dongfeng Motors Corporation (“Dongfeng Motor”) which is one of the
largest automobile manufacturers in China, producing over 3.76 million cars and trucks in 2012. Aoxin Automobile was funded by
Dongfeng Motors to develop and manufacture a lightweight, super-efficient, carbon fiber e-Go EV electric car (“e-Go EV”). Dongfeng
Motor, over a five year period, invested a substantial amount of money to develop with the support of Italian engineers a new
carbon fiber technology to produce carbon fiber parts at a significantly reduced cost. They also developed a lightweight aluminum
racing frame to ultimately create the ultralight weight electric automobile known as the e-Go. In
2014, Yancheng Municipal State-Owned Asset Investment Group, Co. Ltd. (YMSIG), an investment and property development company
founded by the Yancheng Municipal Government, purchased Aoxin Automobile from Dongfeng Motor, Co. Ltd. YMSIG has made major investments
in Aoxin, which funded on a fast track schedule the completion of the e-Go automobile manufacturing facility that culminated in
a grand opening ceremony on January 20, 2015. The
e-Go EV is a unique concept electric vehicle. It will be the only production line electric vehicle with a carbon fiber body manufactured
by a new process that uses robotics to produce parts, which significantly reduces the production time and cost of carbon fiber
components. The carbon fiber composite material is five times stronger than steel, and one third the weight. The
exclusive license contract between 2050 Motors and Aoxin Automobile requires that 2050 Motors complete US crash testing according
to US Department of Transportation (“DOT”) safety standards. 2050 Motors has entered into negotiations with Calspan
Corporation (“Calspan”). Calspan is committed to the evolution of safety in the air and on the ground, and has assisted
in developing new aircraft; training world-class test pilots; performing ground-breaking automobile accident research; and contributing
to safety innovations on the ground and in the air over its 70-year history. It’s important to note that one of the three
demonstration vehicles that will be shipped to the United States by June 2015 will be used to evaluate this overlap crash test
at Calspan’s facilities during the summer of 2015. This will be a definitive evaluation of the effectiveness of the design
modifications incorporated into the e-Go EV vehicle. There is no assurance that the e-Go EV will pass this crash test in June
2015 or at any other time. 2050
Motors intends to import vehicles completely fabricated and assembled in China from Aoxin Automobile. 2050 Motors will market
the e-Go EV vehicles in designated markets and is not expected to need any raw materials, components or equipment, except spare
parts which will be supplied by Aoxin Automobile. However, the e-Go EV and all of its parts and equipment must be DOT approved.
After the demonstration vehicles are delivered to the USA, some of the existing parts of the e-Go EV may or may not meet DOT specifications.
Aoxin Automobile has made every effort to build the e-Go EV according to American standards. However, there is no certainty that
all the parts will be DOT approved. 2050 Motors may elect to secure replacement parts here in the USA or in China for installation
either in the United States or in China, if required. 2050
Motors intends to initially sell the e-Go EV to a network of customers primarily in the Las Vegas, Nevada area. 2050 Motors plans
to establish a service and parts center, which would be separate from the Showroom. The Showroom facility will be at an area with
high volume of people in Las Vegas, where visitors to the city can directly view the e-Go EV. 2050 Motors may also elect to sell
the e-Go EV at selected distributors in the Las Vegas Area, which have already provided letters of interest to sell our vehicles.
2050 Motors’ initial plan is not to sell the vehicle outside of the Las Vegas vicinity, consisting of an area within a radius
of 100 miles. This is the Company’s current marketing plan in order to effectively market to and support people that work
and/or live in Las Vegas. In the metropolitan area of Las Vegas the population equals
1.9 million. 2050
Motors is a development stage company with no operating history and may never be able to carry out its business plan or achieve
any revenues or profitability. 2050 Motors was established in October 2012 and it has not generated any revenues nor has it realized
a profit from its operations to date, and there is little likelihood that it will generate any revenues or realize any profits
in the short term. Any profitability in the future from its business will be dependent upon the successful marketing and sales
of the e-Go EV. 2050 Motors may not be able to successfully carry out its business plan. There can be no assurance that it will
ever achieve any revenues or profitability. Accordingly, its prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses, and
difficulties frequently encountered in establishing a new business, especially one in the automobile industry, and therefore it
is a highly speculative venture involving significant financial risk. 12 We
are completely dependent on Aoxin Automobile to supply us with the e-Go EV and other trucks and automobiles and parts and components
thereto. The inability of Aoxin Automobile to continue to deliver, or their refusal to deliver such vehicles and parts at prices
and volumes acceptable to us would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects and operating results. Changes in
business conditions, global financial instability, wars, governmental changes, and other factors beyond our control or which we
do not presently anticipate, could also affect Aoxin Automobile’s ability to deliver vehicles and/or parts on a timely basis
and cause material adverse consequences to 2050 Motors. Research
by Aoxin Automobile over the past five years developed this advanced all-electric vehicle. The e-Go EV is a five passenger sedan
which weighs only 1,450 lbs with its battery pack included. It will be the first vehicle of this advanced type to be sold in the
price range of less than $35,000. The
body components are built out of carbon fiber which is five times stronger than steel and one third its weight constructed over
a strong ultralight aluminum frame chassis and race car suspension. This ensures that the vehicle will be one of the safest and
strongest ever built for the consumer market. It will also be the most efficient vehicle ever built, capable of achieving 200+
miles to the gallon energy equivalent. 2050
Motors projects expenses associated with its business over the next 6 months to be approximately $1,000,000. Costs
and Resources The
Company believes that its current capital resources and current funding will enable it to maintain its current and planned operations
through the next 6 months. The Company anticipates, however, that it will need to raise additional capital in order to sustain
and grow its operations over the next few years. To
the extent that the Company’s capital resources are insufficient to meet current or planned operating requirements, the
Company will seek additional funds through equity or debt financing, collaborative or other arrangements with corporate partners,
licensees or others, and from other sources, which may have the effect of diluting the holdings of existing shareholders. The
Company has no current arrangements with respect to, or sources of, such additional financing and the Company does not anticipate
that existing shareholders will provide any portion of the Company’s future financing requirements. No assurance can be
given that additional financing will be available when needed or that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to
the Company. If adequate funds are not available, the Company may be required to delay or terminate expenditures for certain of
its programs that it would otherwise seek to develop and commercialize. This would have a material adverse effect on the Company. Results
of Operation for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 During
the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company had no revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company
incurred operating expenses of $546,072 consisting primarily of consulting fees and travel expenses and other general and administrative
costs of 2050 Motors. During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company incurred operating expenses of $282,206. These operating
expenses combined with a lack of revenues resulted in net losses of $(546,072) and $(282,206) for the periods ended December 31,
2014 and 2013, respectively. As of December 31, 2014 the Company had stockholders’ equity of $868,747 compared to a stockholders’
equity of $407,648 as of December 31, 2013. The increase in stockholders’ equity was due to the acquisition of 2050 Motors
in May 2014 and private placements of securities of approximately $955,400 during the year ended December 31, 2014. Equity
and Capital Resources We
have incurred losses since inception of our business and, as of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $1,046,874.
As of December 31, 2014, we had cash of $756,675 and working capital of $667,838. To
date, we have funded our operations through short-term debt and equity financing. From inception, we have borrowed approximately
$150,000 as an advance from our largest stockholder. In May 2014, we agreed to issue 106,000 shares of common stock to Alfred
E. Booth, Jr., our largest stockholder) in full satisfaction of $106,412, which was the total owed to Mr. Booth, Jr. as of that
date. The Company completed private placements during the year ended December 31, 2014 with the receipt of aggregate proceeds
of $955,400 from the sale of 2,741,146 shares of its common stock at $0.35 per share. The proceeds from the sale of equity were
used to pay fees and expenses, to the extent that such expenses are not deferred, arising from the Company’s compliance
with its public reporting requirements and to continue to proceed with its business plan to market, develop and sell electric
automobiles. We
expect our expenses will continue to increase during the foreseeable future as a result of increased operational expenses and
the development of our automobile business. However, we do not expect to start generating revenues from our operations for another
12 months. Consequently, we are dependent on the proceeds from future debt or equity investments to sustain our operations and
implement our business plan. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital, we will be required to delay or forego some portion
of our business plan, which would have a material adverse affect on our anticipated results from operations and financial condition.
There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary amounts of additional capital or that our estimates of our capital
requirements will prove to be accurate. As of the date of this Report we did not have any commitments from any source to provide
such additional capital. Even if we are able to secure outside financing, it may not be available in the amounts or the times
when we require. Furthermore, such financing would likely take the form of bank loans, private placement of debt or equity securities
or some combination of these. The issuance of additional equity securities would dilute the stock ownership of current investors
while incurring loans, leases or debt would increase our capital requirements and possible loss of valuable assets if such obligations
were not repaid in accordance with their terms. 13 Off-balance
Sheet Arrangements Since
our inception through December 31, 2014, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements. Recent
Accounting Pronouncements We
have adopted all applicable recently issued accounting pronouncements. The adoption of the accounting pronouncements did not have
a material effect on our operations. Item

TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Report of Farber Hass Hurley LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm F-2 Balance sheets, December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 F-3 Statements of operations, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 F-4 Statement of stockholders’ equity, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 F-5 Statements of cash flows, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 F-6 Notes to financial statements F-7 F- 1 REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 2050 Motors, Inc. We have audited the accompanying balance
sheets of 2050 Motors. Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related statements of operations,
stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two period ended December 31, 2014. The Company’s
management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The
Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our
audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate
in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of 2050 Motors. Inc. as of December 31, 2014
and 2013, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two period ended December 31, 2014,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying financial statements
have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements,
the Company has not earned any revenues since inception and has an accumulated deficit of $1,046,874 as of December 31, 2014,
which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustment

BUSINESS 2050
Motors, Inc., (the “Company”) was formed to import, market, and sell electric cars manufactured in China. 2050 Motors
has entered into an agreement with Jiangsu Aoxin New Energy Automobile Co., Ltd., located in Jiangsu, China (“Aoxin”),
for the distribution in the United States of a new electric automobile, known as the e-Go EV. 2.
GOING CONCERN The
Company’s ability to continue in existence is dependent on its ability to develop additional sources of capital, and/or
achieve profitable operations, positive cash flows, and the successful distribution of the vehicles in the USA markets. Management’s
plan is to aggressively pursue its present business plan. Since inception the Company has funded its operations through the issuance
of common stock and related party funding and advances, and will seek additional debt or equity financing as required. However,
there can be no assurance that the Company would be successful in raising such additional funds. The accompanying financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 3.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Use
of Estimates The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash Cash
consists of deposits in one large national bank. Advertising
Costs Costs
incurred for producing and communicating advertising are expensed when incurred and included in selling general and administrative
expenses. Advertising expense amounted to $720 and $750 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Property
and Equipment Property
and equipment are stated at cost. Major renewals and improvements are charged to the asset accounts while replacements, maintenance
and repairs, which do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are expensed. At the time property and equipment
are retired or otherwise disposed of, the asset and related accumulated depreciation accounts are relieved of the applicable amounts.
Gains or losses from retirements or sales are credited or charged to income. Depreciation
is calculated using straight-line method over the assets estimated useful lives as follows: Furniture and fixtures 7 years Leasehold improvements Lessor of lease term or life of related assets Vehicles and parts 3 years Tools and equipment 5 years Depreciation
for the year ended December 31, 2014 totaled $8,016. No depreciation expense was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2013. Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets and Assets The
Company reviews long-lived assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than
the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recorded. No impairment losses were recognized for the year ended December
31, 2014 and 2013. F- 7 2050
Motors, Inc. Notes
To Financial Statements 3. SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Earnings
Per Share Basic
earnings per share are computed by dividing earnings available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding
common shares during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number
of shares outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been
outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued. For the years ended December 31, 2014, and 2013, the Company
has incurred losses; therefore the effect of any Common Stock equivalent would be anti-dilutive during those periods. There were
no warrants, options, or other stock equity outstanding as of December 31, 2014 and 2013. Concentration
of Credit Risk Cash
is mainly maintained by one highly qualified institution in the United States. As of December 31, 2014, the bank balance was in
excess of federally insured limits. Management does not believe that the Company is subject to any unusual financial risk beyond
the normal risk associated with commercial banking relationships. The Company has not experienced any losses on our deposits of
cash. Recent
Accounting Pronouncement On
January 1, 2013, the Company adopted the new accounting standard that requires disclosures about offsetting and related arrangements
for derivatives, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, securities borrowing, and securities lending transactions.
The adoption of this accounting standard did not have any impact on the Company’s financial statements. On
January 1, 2013, the Company adopted the new accounting standard that provides the option to evaluate qualitative factors to determine
whether a calculated impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets is necessary. The adoption of this accounting standard
did not have any impact on the Company’s financial statements. In
February 2013, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that provides guidance for the recognition, measurement, and disclosure
of obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements. This new accounting standard is effective as of January
1, 2014. The adoption of this accounting standard did not have any impact on the Company’s financial statements. In
July 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued a new accounting standard that requires an unrecognized
tax benefit to be presented as a decrease in a deferred tax asset where a net operating loss, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit
carryforward exists and certain criteria are met. The new accounting standard is effective as of January 1, 2014 and is consistent
with the Company’s present practice. In
May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (Topic 606). Topic 606 supersedes
the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, “Revenue Recognition”, including most industry-specific revenue
recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. In addition, the amendments create a new Subtopic 340-40,
“Other Assets and Deferred Costs—Contracts with Customers”. In summary, the core principle of Topic 606 is that
an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the
consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. For a public entity, the amendments
in this Update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within
that reporting period. Early application is not permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have
on Company’s financial position and statement of operations. In
June 2014, FASB issued amendment 2014-10 that eliminates certain financial reporting requirements for Development Stage Entities.
This amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014 and interim periods therein. Early
application is permitted. The Company adopted this amendment effective July 1, 2014 by removing the following disclosures: a)
Presentation of inception-to-date information in the statement of income, cash flows and shareholder equity. b) Labeling the financial statements as those of a development stage
entity. c)
Description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged. F- 8 2050

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) In
August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)
No. 2014-15, “Presentation of Financial Statements – Going Concern”, Subtopic 205-40, “Disclosure of Uncertainties
about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.” The amendments in this ASU apply to all entities and require
management to assess an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles
that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt,
(2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods, (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating
effect of management’s plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration
of management’s plans, (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated,
and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to
be issued). The amendments in this Update are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods
and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will
have on Company’s financial position and results of operations. Income
Taxes The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. This statement requires an asset and liability approach
for accounting for income taxes. The accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America provides accounting
and disclosure guidance about positions taken by an entity in its tax returns that might be uncertain. The
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America provides accounting and disclosure guidance about positions
taken by an organization in its tax returns that might be uncertain. Management has considered its tax positions and believes
that all of the positions taken by the Company in its Federal and State tax returns are more likely than not to be sustained upon
examination. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. and various state jurisdictions. The Company is subject to examinations
by U.S. Federal and State tax authorities from 2012 (inception) to the present, generally for three years after they are filed. Foreign
Currency Risk Any
significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates may have significant impact on Company’s future financial statements
upon fulfilling certain purchase commitments in accordance to the license agreement disclosed in Note 8. 4. PROPERTY
AND EQUIPMENT Property
and equipment consist of the following as of December 31, 2014: Furniture and fixtures $ 14,303 Leasehold improvements 14,082 Vehicles and parts 18,450 Tools and equipment 21,490 68,325 Less: accumulated depreciation 8,016 Property and equipment, net $ 60,309 5. VEHICLE
DEPOSITS 2050
Motors has made deposits for three prototype test models for delivery into the United States. One will undergo an advanced crash
test known in the Automobile Safety Industry as the “overlap crash test” designed by the Insurance Institute for Highway
Safety. The other two will be used for marketing and sales purposes. Actual production line models are not expected to be deliverable
until the second quarter of 2015. The
total purchase price for these three vehicles was $86,000. This was paid by 2050 Motors in increments of $25,800 on August 20,
2013 and $60,200 on December 4, 2013. 6.
LICENSE AGREEMENT In
2012 and 2013, the Company made payments totaling $50,000 and signed an exclusive license agreement with Aoxin to import, assemble
and manufacture the advanced carbon fiber electric vehicle, the e-Go EV model. The cost of this license agreement has been recognized
as a long-term asset and is evaluated, by management, for impairment losses at each reporting period. F- 9 2050

SHORT-TERM ADVANCES On
June 30, 2014, the Company borrowed $50,000 from a shareholder. The loan bears 12% interest. The entire amount plus interest was
fully paid on July 25, 2014. On
August 29, 2014 and September 30, 2014, the Company issued two loans for a total amount of $100,000 due to a shareholder. The
loans bear 12% interest and mature on February 28, 2015 and March 30, 2015, respectively. The entire balances plus accrued interest
were outstanding as of December 31, 2014. As of the audit report date, the Company had not paid the outstanding balance of the
first loan which matured on February 28, 2015 but is in negotiation with the lender to change the terms. During
the year ended December 31, 2013, a third party advanced funds to the Company for the amount of $40,067. The advance is due upon
demand and bears no interest. As of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the outstanding balance due to this third party was
$763, and $1,763, respectively. 8.
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES In
November 2013, the Company signed a new facility lease. The monthly lease amount is $2,400. The lease term commenced on December
15, 2013 and will expire on December 31, 2015. Effective
January 1, 2014, the Company signed a residential lease agreement in California for its traveling consultants. The monthly lease
amount is $1,900 per month and expires on August 15, 2015. Effective
March 1, 2014, the Company signed a four thousand square feet of industrial space in North Las Vegas. The term of the lease is
for three years and cost $2,200 per month. In
November 2014, the Company signed a one year lease agreement for a storage facility. The Company prepaid the entire lease amount
with 10,000 shares of Company’s common stock for an amount of approximately $13,000. Rent
expenses were $68,711 and $1,275 for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The
minimum aggregate payments due under these leases are as follows: Years ending December: 2015 $ 70,400 2016 26,400 2017 8,800 $ 105,600 According
to the license agreement signed between the Company and Aoxin, in order to maintain exclusive rights for the United States (US),
the Company is required to purchase and sell certain amount of e-Go EV model vehicles per year for a certain period of time starting
from the completion of the requirements established by the United States Department of Transportation’s protocols for the
e-Go EV model. The table below demonstrates the required amount of vehicles that the Company needs to sell per year. First year 2,000 Second year 6,000 Third year 12,000 Fourth year 24,000 Fifth year 48,000 92,000 As
part of the license agreement, the Company is committed to pay expenses related to any required airbag testing procedures. The
cost of these airbags could be as little as $500,000 or as much as $2 million. No testing has been performed through December
31, 2014. F- 10 2050

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued) The
Company may from time to time, become a party to various legal proceedings, arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company
investigates these claims as they arise. Management does not believe, based on current knowledge, that there were any such claims
outstanding as of December 31, 2014 and 2013. 9.
INCOME TAXES The
Company did not file its income tax returns for fiscal year 2012 and 2013. Management believes that it should not have any material
impact on the Company’s financials because the Company did not have any tax liabilities due to net loss incurred for these
years. Based
on the available information and other factors, management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets
at December 31, 2014 and 2013 will not be fully realizable. Accordingly, management has recorded a full valuation allowance against
its net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2014 and 2013. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company had federal net operating
loss carry-forwards of approximately $1,047,000 and $501,000, respectively, expiring beginning in 2032. Deferred
tax assets consist of the following components: December 31, 2014 December 31, 2013 Net loss carryforward $ 290,000 $ 140,000 Valuation allowance (290,000 ) (140,000 ) Total deferred tax assets $ - $ - 10. EQUITY On
May 2, 2014, Zegarelli Group International (“Zegarelli”) (OTCBB:ZEGG), signed an Agreement of Reorganization (the
“Acquisition Agreement”) with 2050 Motors, Inc., and certain stockholders of 2050 Motors, Inc. whereby Zegarelli acquired
all of the issued and outstanding shares of 2050 Motors, Inc. common stock in exchange for 24,994,670 shares of Zegarelli common
stock, and the 2050 Motors, Inc. stockholders became the majority owners of Zegarelli. In conjunction with this announcement,
Zegarelli filed a Schedule 14F-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) relating to the change in
the majority of its board of directors to a group of directors designated by 2050 Motors, Inc. In accordance with the close of
the transaction Zegarelli changed its name to 2050 Motors, Inc., and affect a reverse stock split of one for four, reducing its
total issued and outstanding shares to 5,670,000 shares prior to the exchange of shares with 2050 Motors, Inc. During
the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company issued 2,741,146 shares of Company’s common stock for $0.35 per share for
a total cash amount of $955,400. During
the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company issued 62,070 shares of Company’s common stock for $51,771 of marketing and
consulting services rendered to the Company. On
October 15, 2014, the Company signed a memorandum of understanding to sell ten (10%) of Company’s equity stock to Yancheng
Municipal State-owned Asset Investment Group. Co. Ltd (YMSIG), an investment and property development company. YMSIG has agreed
to purchase 3,750,000 shares of Company’s common stock for a purchase price of $0.75 cents per share. The purchase by YMSIG
of a 10% equity position of 2050 Motors must be approved by officials in China. F- 11 Item 9. Changes In and Disagreements
With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. Not Applicable Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures
are designed with an objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, such as this Annual Report on Form 10-K, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Disclosure controls are also designed with an objective of ensuring
that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer, in order to allow
timely consideration regarding required disclosures. The evaluation of our disclosure controls
by our principal executive officer included a review of the controls’ objectives and design, the operation of the controls,
and the effect of the controls on the information presented in this Annual Report. Our management, including our chief executive
officer, does not expect that disclosure controls can or will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud, if any. A control system,
no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control
system are met. Also, projections of any evaluation of the disclosure controls and procedures to future periods are subject to
the risk that the disclosure controls and procedures may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. As of the end of the period covered
by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based
on that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that there were weaknesses
in our internal controls over Financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 and they were therefore not effective to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and
forms. The weaknesses in our controls and procedure were failure to timely file tax returns, lack of formal documents such
as invoices and consulting agreements and lack of evidence for proper approval and review of disbursements. Management does
not believe that any of these weaknesses materially affected the results and accuracy of its financial statements. However, in
view of this discovery of such weaknesses, management has begun a review to improve them. MANAGEMENT’S ANNUAL REPORT
ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING . Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company in accordance with as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the (i) effectiveness and efficiency of operations, (ii) reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and (iii) compliance with applicable
laws and regulations. Our internal controls framework is based on the criteria set forth in the Internal Control - Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management’s assessment of the
effectiveness of the small business issuer’s internal control over financial reporting is as of the year ended December
31, 2014. We believe that internal controls over financial reporting as set forth above shows some weaknesses and are not effective.
We have identified certain weaknesses considering the nature and extent of our current operations and any risks or errors in financial
reporting under current operations. This annual report does not include
an attestation report of the company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
Management’s report was not subject to attestation by the Company’s registered public accounting firm pursuant to
rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management’s report in this annual report. CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER
FINANCIAL REPORTING. On May 2, 2014, in accordance with
the Reorganization the shareholders of 2050 Motors became the owners of approximately 82% of the issued and outstanding common
stock of the Company. As a result of the Reorganization, we acquired the operations and assets of 2050 Motors as described
herein and a new Chief Financial Officer, accounting personnel and new internal control procedures. 15 MANAGEMENT’S REMEDIATION INITIATIVES Subsequent to the end of the period
covered by this report, and in light of the weakness described above, management is in the process of designing and implementing
improvements in its internal control over financial reporting and we currently plan tom hire an independent third party consultant
to assist in identifying and determining the appropriate accounting procedures and controls to implement. Item 9B. Other Information. Not applicable. PART III Item 10. Directors,

the Company are elected annually by the Board of Directors. The directors serve one-year terms until their successors are elected.
The executive officers serve terms of one year or until their death, resignation or removal by the Board of Directors. There are
no family relationships among any of the officers and directors. Name Age Position(s) Michael Hu 61 President, Chief Financial Officer and Director Bernd Schaefers 73 Secretary and Director Mark R. Edwards, Ph.D 67 Director Michael Hu was born in China.
Michael received advanced educational classes and upon release he achieved a Degree in Metallurgical Engineering from Tongji University
in Shanghai, China. Mr. Hu traveled to the United States in 1986 to continue his education and became a US citizen in 2000. Michael
has devoted his adult life to increasing friendly relationships between the United States and China. He has concentrated categorically
on projects that are Earth friendly to create a better environment for the world. In the 1990s, he assisted and invested in a
photo-voltaic cell manufacturing facility that today produces the most advanced flexible photo-voltaic cells in the world with
manufacturing facilities both in the United States and China. See http://www.xunlight.com . Mr. Hu has been instrumental in developing
advanced lubrication products to increase the efficiency of all types of machinery. Michael coordinated an Agreement in the late
1990s to export American made lubricants to China and also coordinated a business to import electric bicycles to the United States
during this period. During the past 15 years, Michael has concentrated his experience, expertise and associations in China and
other countries to promote technologies for environmental purposes. Michael generously donates his time and efforts to this end
for several companies with no compensation. Some of his efforts in the late 1990s and 2000s have led to the development of advanced
lubrication for the US military. During the past 5 years, Mr. Hu has devoted much of his time to advanced electric vehicles designed
and manufactured in Italy and China. Michael formed 2050 Motors, Inc., a company to import to the United States the most advanced
automobile ever built, with a complete carbon fiber body assembled over an aluminum space age frame. The car is all-electric and
powered by advanced lithium ion batteries. Bernd Schaefers is a veteran
self-made businessman with over 40 years of work in the media industry, thereof over 20 years in the advertising and marketing
sector. Mr. Schaefers founded one of the most successful advertising production companies, Interteam Productions, in the 1970s
with offices in Germany, Switzerland, France and Brazil. His client list included Lufthansa, Shell Oil, Polaroid, Reynolds, Audi
and Volkswagen. He worked directly with Ferdinand Piech, now Chairman of Volkswagen, on the launch of the ‘Audi 5000’
in the United States. Mr. Schaefers was for many years co-owner of the largest movie production and distribution companies in
Germany, ‘Constantin Films’, with internationally successful movies like “The Never-Ending Story”, an
all-time children favorite, “The Name of the Rose”, with Sean Connery, the James Bond movie “Never Say Never
Again”, also with Sean Connery, as the German distribution and financing partner, among many other movies. In parallel,
Bernd Schaefers has over 30 years of involvement in renewable energy. Bernd has funded Research and Development projects with
Idaho National Laboratories (INL) for CO 2 recycling, catalytic conversion of syn-gas to higher alcohols and natural
gas liquefaction technologies. Mr. Schaefers has for many years been involved in the commercialization of algae production and
has provided matching funds for Cal Poly’s ‘Micro-Algae Photo- Bioreactor’ program with Prof. Ilhamil Yildiz
in San Luis Obispo. Mr. Schaefers was a founding member of the 110 MMGY ‘American Ethanol’ plant in Santa Maria, California,

His books are also available on Amazon.com and other retailers. Term of Office All officers and directors listed above
will remain in office until the next annual meeting of our stockholders, and until their successors have been duly elected and
qualified or until removed from office in accordance with our bylaws. There are no agreements with respect to the election of
Directors. We have not compensated our Directors for service on our Board of Directors, any committee thereof, or reimbursed for
expenses incurred for attendance at meetings of our Board of Directors and/or any committee of our Board of Directors. Officers
are appointed annually by our Board of Directors and each Executive Officer serves at the discretion of our Board of Directors.
We do not have any standing committees. Our Board of Directors may in the future determine to pay Directors’ fees and reimburse
Directors for expenses related to their activities. None of our Officers and/or Directors
have filed any bankruptcy petition, been convicted of or been the subject of any criminal proceedings or the subject of any order,
judgment or decree involving the violation of any state or federal securities laws within the past five (5) years. Board Committees Audit Committee We do not have a standing audit committee
of the Board of Directors. Management has determined not to establish an audit committee at present because of our limited resources
and limited operating activities do not warrant the formation of an audit committee or the expense of doing so. We do not have
a financial expert serving on the Board of Directors or employed as an officer based on management’s belief that the cost
of obtaining the services of a person who meets the criteria for a financial expert under Item 401(e) of Regulation S-B is beyond
its limited financial resources and the financial skills of such an expert are simply not required or necessary for us to maintain
effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting in light of the limited scope and simplicity of accounting
issues raised in its financial statements at this stage of its development. Code of Ethics To date, we have not adopted a Code
of Ethics applicable to our principal executive officer and principal financial officer because the Company has no meaningful
operations. The Company does not believe that a formal written code of ethics is necessary at this time. We expect that the Company
will adopt a code of ethics if and when the Company successfully completes a business combination that results in the acquisition
of an on-going business and thereby commences operations. Our directors and officers devote time
to our affairs on an “as needed” basis, but less than 10 hours per month. As a result, the actual amount of time that
they will devote to our affairs is unknown and is likely to vary substantially from month to month. Our directors will serve until
the next annual meeting of shareholders or until their successors are duly elected and have qualified. Officers hold their positions
at the pleasure of the board of directors, absent any employment agreement, of which none currently exists or is contemplated.
There is no arrangement or understanding between any person pursuant to which any director or officer was or is to be selected
as a director or officer, and there is no arrangement, plan or understanding as to whether non-management shareholders will exercise
their voting rights to continue to elect directors to our board. There are also no arrangements, agreements or understandings
between non-management shareholders that may directly or indirectly participate in or influence the management of our affairs.
Our Board of Directors does not have any committees at this time. 17 Indemnification of Executive Officers
and Directors Our Articles of Incorporation and by-laws
provide for indemnification of directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by the California General Corporation Law
(the “CGCL”). Section 317 of the CGCL provides that any director or officer of a California corporation may be indemnified
against judgments, penalties, fines, settlements and reasonable expenses actually incurred by him in connection with or in defending
any action, suit or proceeding in which he is a party by reason of his position, so long as it shall be determined that he conducted
himself in good faith and that he reasonably believed that his conduct was in the corporation’s best interest and, with
respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. If a director
or officer is wholly successful, on the merits or otherwise, in connection with such proceeding, such indemnification is mandatory. We have agreed to indemnify each of
our directors and certain officers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933. Currently we do not maintain any directors’
and officers’ liability insurance covering our directors and officers against expenses and liabilities arising from certain
actions to which they may become subject by reason of having served in such role. At present, there is no pending litigation
or proceeding involving any of our directors, officers, employees or agents where indemnification will be required under California
law. We are not aware of any threatened litigation or preceding that might result in a claim for such indemnification. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities
arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the provisions
described above, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy
as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against
such liabilities (other than our payment of expenses incurred or paid by our director, officer or controlling person in the successful
defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the
securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent,
submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed
in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 16(a) OF
THE EXCHANGE ACT Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires
officers, directors and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities of a company that has a class
of common stock registered under the Exchange Act to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and
Exchange Commission and to furnish us with copies of all forms filed pursuant to Section 16(a). Based solely on a review of the copies
of such reports furnished to us, we believe that our officers and directors and our principal stockholder who are required to
file reports pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act complied with all of the Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable
to them with respect to the last fiscal year, except that our officers and directors and shareholder failed to file a Form 3 after
we registered our common stock under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange timely. All of the Form 3’s have now been
filed and the Company has taken action to insure that all future Section 16(a) reports are timely filed. Item 11. Executive Compensation None of our directors or executive
officers received any cash or non-cash compensation from us during the past three fiscal years or had outstanding equity awards
at year end. We have not entered into employment agreements with our executive officers and their compensation, if any, will be
determined at the discretion of our Board of Directors. We do not offer retirement benefit
plans to our executive officers, nor have we entered into any contract, agreement, plan or arrangement, whether written or unwritten,
that provides for payments to a named executive officer at, or in connection with, the resignation, retirement or other termination
of a named executive officer, or a change in control of the company or a change in the named executive officer’s responsibilities
following a change in control. We do not have any standard arrangement for compensation of our directors for any services provided
as director, including services for committee participation or for special assignments. The Company does not have a compensation
committee. Given the nature of the Company’s business, its limited stockholder base and the current composition
of management, the board of directors does not believe that the Company requires a compensation committee at this time. The following table summarizes all
compensation recorded by us in 2014, 2013 and 2012 for our principal executive officer, each other executive officer serving as
such whose annual compensation exceeded $100,000, and up to two additional individuals for whom disclosure would have been made
in this table but for the fact that the individual was not serving as an executive officer of our company at December 31, 2014.
The value attributable to any option awards is computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. The assumptions made in the valuations
of the option awards are included in Note 2 of the Notes to our Financial Statements appearing later in this report. 18 SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE Name and Principal Position Year Salary($) Bonus($) Stock Awards($) Option Awards($) Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation($) Nonqualified Deferred Compensation($) All Other Compensation($) Total($) Michael Hu (1) 2014 0 50,440 0 0 0 0 0 0 Alfred Booth (2) 2014 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2013 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2012 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 (1) Appointed President and Chief Financial Officer and Director on May 2, 2014.

Employment Agreement The Company has no Employment Agreement
with any of its officers or directors. Stock Option Plan We do not have a stock option plan
although we may adopt one or more such plans in the future. Employee Pension, Profit Sharing
or other Retirement Plans We do not have a defined benefit, pension
plan, profit sharing or other retirement plan, although we may adopt one or more of such plans in the future. Item 12. Security Ownership
of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters. The following table sets forth, as
of the closing of the acquisition of 2050 Motors, certain information with respect to the Company’s equity securities owned
of record or beneficially by (i) each Officer and Director of the Company; (ii) each person who owns beneficially more than five
percent (5%) of each class of the Company’s outstanding equity securities; and (iii) all Directors and Executive Officers
as a group. Title of Class Name and Address of Beneficial Owner (2) Amount and Nature of Beneficial Ownership Percent of Class (1) Common Stock Michael Hu, Pres., CFO & Dir. 9,060,000 27.1 % Common Stock Bernd Schaefers, Sec. & Dir 1,250,000 3.7 % Common Stock Mark R. Edwards, Ph.D., Dir. 25,000 * Common Stock All Directors and Officers as a Group (3 persons) 10,335,000 33.83 % * Less than 1% (1) Unless otherwise indicated, based on 33,437,886 shares of common stock issued and outstanding following the acquisition of 2050 Motors. Shares of common stock subject to options or warrants currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days, are deemed outstanding for purposes of computing the percentage of the person holding such options or warrants, but are not deemed outstanding for the purposes of computing the percentage of any other person. (2) Unless indicated otherwise, the address of the shareholder is c/o 2050 Motors, Inc., 3420 Bunkerhill Dr., Las Vegas, NV 89032. We are not aware of any person who
owns of record, or is known to own beneficially, five percent or more of the outstanding securities of any class of the issuer,
other than as set forth above. There are no classes of stock other than common stock issued or outstanding. There are no current arrangements which
will result in a change in control. 19 Item 13. Certain Relationships
and Related Transactions and Director Independence. Related Party Transactions The following information summarizes
transactions we have either engaged in for the past three fiscal years, or propose to engage in, involving our executive officers,
directors, more than 5% shareholders, or immediate family members of these persons. These transactions were negotiated between
related parties without “arm’s length” bargaining and, as a result, the terms of these transactions may be different
than transactions negotiated between unrelated persons. We had utilized the mailing address
of Alfred E. Booth, Jr., our former President, from January, 2012, to May 2, 2014, at no cost. Except as set forth above, there have
been no related party transactions, or any other transactions or relationships required to be disclosed. Director Independence Our Common Stock is not quoted or listed
on any national exchange or interdealer quotation system with a requirement that a majority of our board of directors be independent
and therefore, the Company is not subject to any director independence requirements. Under NASDAQ Rule 5605(a)(2)(A), a director
is not considered to be independent if he or she is also an executive officer or employee of the corporation. Under such definition
our three officers and directors would not be considered an independent director. Item 14. Principal Accountant
Fees and Services. During 2014 and 2013, Farber Hass Hurley,
LLP, the Company’s independent auditors, have billed for their services as set forth below. In addition, fees and services
related to the audit of the financial statements of the Company for the period ended December 31, 2014, as contained in this Report,
are estimated and included for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014. Year ended December 31, 2014 2013 Audit Fees $ 25,000 $ 10,000 Audit-Related Fees $ -0- $ -0- Tax Fees $ -0- $ -0- All Other Fees $ -0- $ -0- Pre-Approval Policy Our Board as a whole pre-approves all
services provided by Farber Hass Hurley, LLP. For any non-audit or non-audit related services, the Board must conclude that such
services are compatible with the independence as our auditors. 20 PART

GOING CONCERN The Companys ability to continue
in existence is dependent on its ability to develop additional sources of capital, and/or achieve profitable operations, positive
cash flows, and the successful distribution of the vehicles in the USA markets. Managements plan is to aggressively pursue
its present business plan. Since inception the Company has funded its operations through the issuance of common stock and related
party funding and advances, and will seek additional debt or equity financing as required. However, there can be no assurance that
the Company would be successful in raising such additional funds. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. Cash Cash Cash consists of deposits in one large
national bank. Advertising Costs Advertising Costs Costs incurred for producing and communicating
advertising are expensed when incurred and included in selling general and administrative expenses. Advertising expense amounted
to $720 and $750 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Property and Equipment Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at
cost. Major renewals and improvements are charged to the asset accounts while replacements, maintenance and repairs, which do not
improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are expensed. At the time property and equipment are retired or otherwise
disposed of, the asset and related accumulated depreciation accounts are relieved of the applicable amounts. Gains or losses from
retirements or sales are credited or charged to income. Depreciation is calculated using straight-line method over
the assets estimated useful lives as follows: Furniture and fixtures 7 years Leasehold improvements Lessor of lease term or life of related assets Vehicles and parts 3 years Tools and equipment 5 years Depreciation for the year ended December
31, 2014 totaled $8,016. No depreciation expense was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2013. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Assets Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
and Assets The Company reviews long-lived assets
to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an
impairment loss is recorded. No impairment losses were recognized for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. Earnings Per Share Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share are computed
by dividing earnings available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period.
Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period
increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive
securities had been issued. For the years ended December 31, 2014, and 2013, the Company has incurred losses; therefore the effect
of any Common Stock equivalent would be anti-dilutive during those periods. There were no warrants, options, or other stock equity
outstanding as of December 31, 2014 and 2013. Concentration of Credit Risk Concentration of Credit Risk Cash is mainly maintained by one highly
qualified institution in the United States. As of December 31, 2014, the bank balance was in excess of federally insured limits.
Management does not believe that the Company is subject to any unusual financial risk beyond the normal risk associated with commercial
banking relationships. The Company has not experienced any losses on our deposits of cash. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recent Accounting Pronouncement On January 1, 2013, the Company adopted the
new accounting standard that requires disclosures about offsetting and related arrangements for derivatives, repurchase agreements,
reverse repurchase agreements, securities borrowing, and securities lending transactions. The adoption of this accounting standard
did not have any impact on the Companys financial statements. On January 1, 2013, the Company adopted the
new accounting standard that provides the option to evaluate qualitative factors to determine whether a calculated impairment test
for indefinite-lived intangible assets is necessary. The adoption of this accounting standard did not have any impact on the Companys
financial statements. In February 2013, the FASB issued a new accounting
standard that provides guidance for the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of obligations resulting from joint and several
liability arrangements. This new accounting standard is effective as of January 1, 2014. The adoption of this accounting standard
did not have any impact on the Companys financial statements. In July 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) issued a new accounting standard that requires an unrecognized tax benefit to be presented as a decrease
in a deferred tax asset where a net operating loss, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists and certain criteria
are met. The new accounting standard is effective as of January 1, 2014 and is consistent with the Companys present practice. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Topic 606 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic
605, Revenue Recognition, including most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics
of the Codification. In addition, the amendments create a new Subtopic 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred CostsContracts
with Customers. In summary, the core principle of Topic 606 is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer
of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled
in exchange for those goods or services. For a public entity, the amendments in this Update are effective for annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is not permitted.
Management is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on Companys financial position and statement of operations. In June 2014, FASB issued amendment 2014-10
that eliminates certain financial reporting requirements for Development Stage Entities. This amendment is effective for annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014 and interim periods therein. Early application is permitted. The Company adopted
this amendment effective July 1, 2014 by removing the following disclosures: a) Presentation of inception-to-date
information in the statement of income, cash flows and shareholder equity. b) Labeling the financial statements as those of a development stage
entity. c) Description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged. In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial
Statements  Going Concern, Subtopic 205-40, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entitys Ability to
Continue as a Going Concern. The amendments in this ASU apply to all entities and require management to assess an entitys
ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing
standards. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt, (2) require an evaluation every
reporting period including interim periods, (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of managements
plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of managements
plans, (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment
for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The amendments in
this Update are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter.
Early application is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on Companys financial
position and results of operations. Income Taxes Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes
in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. This statement requires an asset and liability approach for accounting for income taxes.
The accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America provides accounting and disclosure guidance about
positions taken by an entity in its tax returns that might be uncertain. The accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America provides accounting and disclosure guidance about positions taken by an organization in
its tax returns that might be uncertain. Management has considered its tax positions and believes that all of the positions taken
by the Company in its Federal and State tax returns are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. The Company files
income tax returns in the U.S. and various state jurisdictions. The Company is subject to examinations by U.S. Federal and State
tax authorities from 2012 (inception) to the present, generally for three years after they are filed. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign Currency Risk Any significant changes in foreign currency
exchange rates may have significant impact on Companys future financial statements upon fulfilling certain purchase commitments
in accordance to the license agreement disclosed in Note 8.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES In November 2013, the Company signed
a new facility lease. The monthly lease amount is $2,400. The lease term commenced on December 15, 2013 and will expire on December
31, 2015. Effective January 1, 2014, the Company
signed a residential lease agreement in California for its traveling consultants. The monthly lease amount is $1,900 per month
and expires on August 15, 2015. Effective March 1, 2014, the Company
signed a four thousand square feet of industrial space in North Las Vegas. The term of the lease is for three years and cost $2,200
per month. In November 2014, the Company signed
a one year lease agreement for a storage facility. The Company prepaid the entire lease amount with 10,000 shares of Companys
common stock for an amount of approximately $13,000. Rent expenses were $68,711, $1,275 for
the year ended December 31, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The minimum aggregate payments due under
these leases are as follows: Years ending December: 2015 $ 70,400 2016 26,400 2017 8,800 $ 105,600 According to the license agreement signed
between the Company and Aoxin, in order to maintain exclusive rights for the United States (US), the Company is required to purchase
and sell certain amount of e-Go EV model vehicles per year for a certain period of time starting from the completion of the requirements
established by the United States Department of Transportations protocols for the e-Go EV model. The table below demonstrates
the required amount of vehicles that the Company needs to sell per year. First year 2,000 Second year 6,000 Third year 12,000 Fourth year 24,000 Fifth year 48,000 92,000 As part of the license agreement, the
Company is committed to pay expenses related to any required airbag testing procedures. The cost of these airbags could be as little
as $500,000 or as much as $2 million. No testing has been performed through December 31, 2014. The Company may from time to time,
become a party to various legal proceedings, arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company investigates these claims

SHORT-TERM ADVANCES On June 30, 2014, the Company borrowed
$50,000 from a shareholder. The loan bears 12% interest. The entire amount plus interest was fully paid on July 25, 2014. On August 29, 2014 and September 30,
2014, the Company issued two loans for a total amount of $100,000 due to a shareholder. The loans bear 12% interest and mature
on February 28, 2015 and March 30, 2015, respectively. The entire balances plus accrued interest were outstanding as of December
31, 2014. As of the audit report date, the Company had not paid the outstanding balance of the first loan which matured on February
28, 2015 but is in negotiation with the lender to change the terms. During the year ended December 31,
2013, a third party advanced funds to the Company for the amount of $40,067. The advance is due upon demand and bears no interest.
As of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the outstanding balance due to this third party was $763, and $1,763, respectively.

INCOME TAXES The Company did not file its income
tax returns for fiscal year 2012 and 2013. Management believes that it should not have any material impact on the Companys
financials because the Company did not have any tax liabilities due to net loss incurred for these years. Based on the available information and
other factors, management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2014 and 2013 will
not be fully realizable. Accordingly, management has recorded a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets at
December 31, 2014 and 2013. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company had federal net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately
$1,047,000 and $501,000, respectively, expiring beginning in 2032. Deferred tax assets consist of the following
components: December 31, 2014 December 31, 2013 Net loss carryforward $ 290,000 $ 140,000 Valuation allowance (290,000 ) (140,000 ) Total deferred tax assets $ - $ - X - Details Name: us-gaap_IncomeTaxDisclosureAbstract Namespace Prefix: us-gaap_ Data Type: xbrli:stringItemType Balance Type: na Period Type: duration X - Definition The entire disclosure for income taxes.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. Cash Cash consists of deposits in one large
national bank. Advertising Costs Costs incurred for producing and communicating
advertising are expensed when incurred and included in selling general and administrative expenses. Advertising expense amounted
to $720 and $750 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at
cost. Major renewals and improvements are charged to the asset accounts while replacements, maintenance and repairs, which do not
improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are expensed. At the time property and equipment are retired or otherwise
disposed of, the asset and related accumulated depreciation accounts are relieved of the applicable amounts. Gains or losses from
retirements or sales are credited or charged to income. Depreciation is calculated using straight-line method over
the assets estimated useful lives as follows: Furniture and fixtures 7 years Leasehold improvements Lessor of lease term or life of related assets Vehicles and parts 3 years Tools and equipment 5 years Depreciation for the year ended December
31, 2014 totaled $8,016. No depreciation expense was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2013. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
and Assets The Company reviews long-lived assets
to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an
impairment loss is recorded. No impairment losses were recognized for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share are computed
by dividing earnings available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period.
Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period
increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive
securities had been issued. For the years ended December 31, 2014, and 2013, the Company has incurred losses; therefore the effect
of any Common Stock equivalent would be anti-dilutive during those periods. There were no warrants, options, or other stock equity
outstanding as of December 31, 2014 and 2013. Concentration of Credit Risk Cash is mainly maintained by one highly
qualified institution in the United States. As of December 31, 2014, the bank balance was in excess of federally insured limits.
Management does not believe that the Company is subject to any unusual financial risk beyond the normal risk associated with commercial
banking relationships. The Company has not experienced any losses on our deposits of cash. Recent Accounting Pronouncement On January 1, 2013, the Company adopted
the new accounting standard that requires disclosures about offsetting and related arrangements for derivatives, repurchase agreements,
reverse repurchase agreements, securities borrowing, and securities lending transactions. The adoption of this accounting standard
did not have any impact on the Companys financial statements. On January 1, 2013, the Company adopted
the new accounting standard that provides the option to evaluate qualitative factors to determine whether a calculated impairment
test for indefinite-lived intangible assets is necessary. The adoption of this accounting standard did not have any impact on the
Companys financial statements. In February 2013, the FASB issued a
new accounting standard that provides guidance for the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of obligations resulting from joint
and several liability arrangements. This new accounting standard is effective as of January 1, 2014. The adoption of this accounting
standard did not have any impact on the Companys financial statements. In July 2013, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) issued a new accounting standard that requires an unrecognized tax benefit to be presented
as a decrease in a deferred tax asset where a net operating loss, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists and certain
criteria are met. The new accounting standard is effective as of January 1, 2014 and is consistent with the Companys present
practice. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.
2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Topic 606 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements
in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, including most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry
Topics of the Codification. In addition, the amendments create a new Subtopic 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred CostsContracts
with Customers. In summary, the core principle of Topic 606 is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer
of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled
in exchange for those goods or services. For a public entity, the amendments in this Update are effective for annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is not permitted.
Management is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on Companys financial position and statement of operations. In June 2014, FASB issued amendment
2014-10 that eliminates certain financial reporting requirements for Development Stage Entities. This amendment is effective for
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014 and interim periods therein. Early application is permitted. The Company
adopted this amendment effective July 1, 2014 by removing the following disclosures: a) Presentation of inception-to-date
information in the statement of income, cash flows and shareholder equity. b) Labeling the financial statements as those of a development stage
entity. c) Description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged. In August 2014, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-15, Presentation of
Financial Statements  Going Concern, Subtopic 205-40, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entitys
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. The amendments in this ASU apply to all entities and require management to assess
an entitys ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently
in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt, (2) require an
evaluation every reporting period including interim periods, (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of managements
plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of managements
plans, (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment
for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The amendments in
this Update are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter.
Early application is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on Companys financial
position and results of operations. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes
in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. This statement requires an asset and liability approach for accounting for income taxes.
The accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America provides accounting and disclosure guidance about
positions taken by an entity in its tax returns that might be uncertain. The accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America provides accounting and disclosure guidance about positions taken by an organization in
its tax returns that might be uncertain. Management has considered its tax positions and believes that all of the positions taken
by the Company in its Federal and State tax returns are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. The Company files
income tax returns in the U.S. and various state jurisdictions. The Company is subject to examinations by U.S. Federal and State
tax authorities from 2012 (inception) to the present, generally for three years after they are filed. Foreign Currency Risk Any significant changes in foreign currency
exchange rates may have significant impact on Companys future financial statements upon fulfilling certain purchase commitments
