 DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTRODUCTION The following is management's discussion and analysis of the significant changes in the financial condition, results of operations,
comprehensive income, capital resources, and liquidity presented in its accompanying consolidated financial statements for ACNB Corporation (the Corporation or ACNB), a financial holding company.
Please read this discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and disclosures included herein. Current performance does not guarantee, assure or indicate similar performance in
the future. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The accounting policies that the Corporation's management deems to be most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and
results of operations, and that require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgment, often result in the need to make estimates about the effect of such matters which are inherently
uncertain. The following policies are deemed to be critical accounting policies by management: The
allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Management makes numerous assumptions, estimates and adjustments in
determining an adequate allowance. The Corporation assesses the level of potential loss associated with its loan portfolio and provides for that exposure through an allowance for loan losses. The
allowance is established through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. The allowance is an estimate of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the end of each reporting period. The
Corporation assesses the adequacy of its allowance on a quarterly basis. The specific methodologies applied on a consistent basis are discussed in greater detail under the caption, Allowance for Loan Losses , in a subsequent section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The
evaluation of securities for other-than-temporary impairment requires a significant amount of judgment. In estimating other-than-temporary impairment losses, management considers
various factors including the length of time the fair value has been below cost, the financial condition of the issuer, and the Corporation's intent to sell, or requirement to sell, the security
before recovery of its value. Declines in fair value that are determined to be other than temporary are charged against earnings. Accounting
Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 350, IntangiblesGoodwill and Other, requires that goodwill is not amortized to
expense, but rather that it be assessed or tested for impairment at least annually. Impairment write-downs are charged to results of operations in the period in which the impairment is determined. The
Corporation did not identify any impairment on its outstanding goodwill from its most recent testing, which was performed as of October 1, 2014. If certain events occur which might indicate
goodwill has been impaired, the goodwill is tested for impairment when such events occur. During the quarter ended June 30, 2012, the Corporation changed its method of applying ASC Topic 350
such that the annual goodwill impairment testing date was changed from December 31 to October 1. This new testing date is preferable under the circumstances, because it allows the
Corporation more time to accurately complete its impairment testing process in order to incorporate the results in the annual consolidated financial statements. Other acquired intangible assets with
finite lives, such as customer lists, are required to be amortized over the estimated lives. These intangibles are generally amortized using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of ten
years. 34 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW The primary source of the Corporation's revenues is net interest income derived from interest earned on loans and investments, less
deposit and borrowing funding costs. Revenues are influenced by general economic factors, including market interest rates, the economy of the markets served, stock market conditions, as well as
competitive forces within the markets. The
Corporation's overall strategy is to increase loan growth in local markets, while maintaining a reasonable funding base by offering competitive deposit products and services. The
year 2014 continued to be challenging for financial institutions with new expensive compliance regulations, slowly recovering housing markets, lingering wage stagnation, and slow uneven growth. ACNB
continued to be profitable and well capitalized despite the aftershocks of the unprecedented challenge to the United States economy in recent years past. Lower provision for loan losses offset
increased expenses resulting in increased net income of $10,290,000, or $1.71 per share, in 2014, compared to $9,315,000, or $1.56 per share, in 2013 and $8,886,000, or $1.49 per share, in 2012.
Returns on average equity were 9.32%, 9.00% and 8.91% in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Because
funding costs were near practical floors, they could not be decreased at the same increments as earning asset decreases; therefore, the Corporation's net interest margin
decreased to 3.47% in 2014, compared to 3.48% and 3.56% in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Net interest income was $33,880,000 in 2014, as compared to $33,612,000 in 2013 and $34,344,000 in 2012. Other
income was $11,904,000, $11,703,000 and $11,867,000 in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The largest source of other income is commissions from insurance sales from Russell
Insurance Group, Inc. (RIG), which increased by 3.6% in 2014 to $4,839,000, boosted by higher contingent commissions and stable commercial insurance volume despite the continued weak economic
conditions. In 2014, a $62,000 gain was recognized on sold or called investments compared to net gains of $0 in 2013 and $7,000 in 2012. Income from fiduciary activities totaled $1,418,000 for 2014,
as compared to $1,299,000 for 2013 and $1,224,000 for 2012. Trust fiduciary income increased from increased estate settlements and new account relationships. Service charges on deposit accounts
decreased 5.7% to $2,118,000 for 2014 due to changes in customer behaviors, while revenue from ATM and debit card transactions increased 8.1% to $1,550,000 due to higher volume. Other
expenses increased to $32,264,000, or by 0.8%, in 2014, as compared to $32,015,000 in 2013. Other expenses totaled $30,331,000 in 2012. The largest component of other expenses is
salaries and employee benefits, which increased 3.0% to $19,516,000 in 2014 compared to $18,950,000 in 2013, due to an increase in employees, merit increases, and the increased cost of benefits,
offset by lower pension expense. Compared to 2013, occupancy expense increased 4.8% in 2014 due to harsh winter expenses and new locations, and equipment expense decreased 2.1% from temporary variance
in expenditures. Professional services expense increased 4.6% despite lower problem loan-related legal expenses in 2014, due to higher compliance and corporate governance. Marketing and corporate
relations expense increased by 48.2% due to website redesign, product specific campaigns and brand awareness activities. FDIC and regulatory expense decreased by 2.6%; however, it is still a
significant expense as the result of a requirement of all FDIC-insured banks to restore and maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund due to protecting depositors' accounts. In 2014, foreclosed real estate
expenses decreased $230,000 or 39.9% resulting from higher final sale losses in 2013. A more thorough discussion of the Corporation's results of operations is included in the following pages. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Interest Income The primary source of ACNB's traditional banking revenue is net interest income, which represents the difference between interest
income on earning assets and interest expense on liabilities 35 Table of Contents used
to fund those assets. Earning assets include loans, securities, and interest bearing deposits with banks. Interest bearing liabilities include deposits and borrowings. Net
interest income is affected by changes in interest rates, volume of interest bearing assets and liabilities, and the composition of those assets and liabilities. The "interest rate
spread" and "net interest margin" are two common statistics related to changes in net interest income. The interest rate
spread represents the difference between the yields earned on interest earning assets and the rates paid for interest bearing liabilities. The net interest margin is defined as the percentage of net
interest income to average earning assets, which also considers the Corporation's net non-interest bearing funding sources, the largest of which are non-interest bearing demand deposits and
stockholders' equity. The
following table includes average balances, rates, interest income and expense, interest rate spread, and net interest margin: Table 1Average Balances, Rates and Interest Income and Expense 2014 2013 2012 Dollars in thousands Average Balance Interest Yield/ Rate Average Balance Interest Yield/ Rate Average Balance Interest Yield/ Rate INTEREST EARNING ASSETS Loans $ 752,837 $ 32,573 4.33 % $ 711,841 $ 32,084 4.51 % $ 701,243 $ 33,990 4.85 % ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Taxable securities 172,698 3,647 2.11 % 186,900 4,230 2.26 % 178,783 4,876 2.73 % Tax-exempt securities 38,380 1,042 2.71 % 41,597 1,197 2.88 % 45,952 1,457 3.17 % ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Securities 211,078 4,689 2.22 % 228,497 5,427 2.38 % 224,735 6,333 2.82 % Other 13,474 264 1.96 % 25,107 90 0.36 % 37,907 116 0.31 % ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Interest Earning Assets 977,389 37,526 3.84 % 965,445 37,601 3.89 % 963,885 40,439 4.20 % ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cash and due from banks 12,838 13,663 13,197 Premises and equipment 15,930 14,603 14,302 Other assets 67,189 63,099 62,345 Allowance for loan losses (15,833 ) (17,072 ) (15,761 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Assets $ 1,057,513 $ 1,039,738 $ 1,037,968 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY INTEREST BEARING LIABILITIES Interest bearing demand deposits $ 179,903 $ 127 0.07 % $ 183,341 $ 140 0.08 % $ 165,569 $ 139 0.08 % Savings deposits 264,467 194 0.07 % 260,093 197 0.08 % 243,050 280 0.12 % Time deposits 239,000 1,489 0.62 % 251,312 1,840 0.73 % 282,568 3,022 1.07 % ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Interest Bearing Deposits 683,370 1,810 0.26 % 694,746 2,177 0.31 % 691,187 3,441 0.50 % Short-term borrowings 44,399 63 0.14 % 53,184 61 0.11 % 48,300 76 0.16 % Long-term borrowings 81,042 1,773 2.19 % 55,311 1,751 3.17 % 74,942 2,578 3.44 % ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Interest Bearing Liabilities 808,811 3,646 0.45 % 803,241 3,989 0.50 % 814,429 6,095 0.75 % ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Non-interest bearing demand deposits 134,355 126,047 116,507 Other liabilities 4,013 6,969 7,255 Stockholders' equity 110,334 103,481 99,777 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity $ 1,057,513 $ 1,039,738 $ 1,037,968 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ NET INTEREST INCOME $ 33,880 $ 33,612 $ 34,344 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ INTEREST RATE SPREAD 3.39 % 3.39 % 3.45 % ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ NET INTEREST MARGIN 3.47 % 3.48 % 3.56 % ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 36 Table of Contents For yield calculation purposes, nonaccruing loans are included in average loan balances. Loan fees of $23,000, $154,000 and $6,000 as of December 31, 2014,
2013 and 2012, respectively, are included in interest income. Yields on tax-exempt securities and loans are not tax effected. Table 1
presents balance sheet items on a daily average basis, net interest income, interest rate spread, and net interest margin for the years ending December 31, 2014,
2013 and 2012. Table 2 analyzes the relative impact on net interest income for changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and changes in rates earned and
paid by the Corporation on such assets and liabilities. Net
interest income totaled $33,880,000 in 2014, as compared to $33,612,000 in 2013 and $34,344,000 in 2012. During 2014, net interest income increased as changes to the earning asset
mix stabilized interest income while lower funding cost allowed for the overall increase. The decrease in net interest income in 2013 was due to declines in rates on earning assets exceeding the
ability to decrease low deposit rates. The
net interest margin during 2014 was 3.47% compared to 3.48% during 2013. The margin decreased due to continued decreasing earning asset yields that exceeded decreasing funding costs
from lower rates on new or renewed time deposits and lower market rates on savings products. The Federal Open
Market Committee repeatedly decreased the federal funds rate from September 2007 to December 2008 and has maintained it at 0% to 0.25% since that time. In addition, the Federal Reserve Bank has
embarked on various programs referred to as Quantitative Easing which, in effect, attempted to lower rates on longer term portions of the yield curve. These decreases allowed interest rate reductions
on lower-cost transactional deposit products and higher-cost certificates of deposit; the result was a 0.05% decrease in funding costs in 2014. Overtaking the benefit of a lower cost of funds in 2014,
however, was earning asset yields decreasing 0.05% from declines in the investment portfolio as new purchases were at lower rates, as well as declines in the loan portfolio from new originations at
lower market rates and existing adjustable-rate loans resetting at lower rates based on declines in index rates. The decreased earning asset yields in 2013 were 0.31% compared to funding cost declines
of 0.25%. Maintaining the net interest margin going forward will be challenged by the fact that substantial amounts of deposits are at practical rate floors, while loans and the investment securities
portfolio will most likely continue to decrease in yields. The cost and availability of wholesale funding could also be affected by a variety of internal and external factors resulting from interest
rate market factors and the creditworthiness of the Corporation and the credit providers. Average
earning assets were $977,389,000 in 2014, an increase of 1.2% from the balance of $965,445,000 in 2013, which was an increase from $963,885,000 in 2012. Loan growth represented
the largest increase in average assets in 2014, 2013 and 2012, in conjunction with changes in the investment portfolio in those years to balance liquidity needs and to fund the loans. Average interest
bearing liabilities were $808,811,000 in 2014, up from $803,241,000 in 2013 and down from $814,429,000 in 2012. Average non-interest bearing demand deposits increased 6.6% in 2014, continuing the
upward trend from 2013 and 2012. This increase was attributed to new relationships and the value placed on stability and FDIC insurance by depositors. On average, deposits (including non-interest
bearing) were down 0.4%, while borrowings increased by 15.6% due to partially funding loan growth and to better match loan terms with Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances in 2014. Lower-cost
transaction and savings deposits grew while time deposits decreased in 2014, continuing a trend started in 2008. This lower time deposit trend is attributed to depositors dissatisfied by the Federal
Reserve induced low rate environment and perhaps investing in equity markets. The
rate/volume analysis detailed in Table 2 shows that the increase in net interest income in 2014 was due to funding cost rate decreases exceeding earning asset rate decreases
and volume increases. Earning asset yields declined due to new purchases at lower rates in the investment portfolio and declines in the loan portfolio from existing adjustable-rate loans resetting at
lower rates and new lower-rate originations replacing loan amortizations at higher rates. In 2014, the decrease in interest expense was 4.6 times higher than the decrease in interest income. Interest
expense decreased due to changes in rates for all interest bearing liability categories. 37 Table of Contents The following table shows changes in net interest income attributed to changes in rates and changes in average balances of interest earning assets and interest

net change attributable to the combination of rate and volume has been allocated on a consistent basis between volume and rate based on the absolute value of each. For yield
calculation purposes, nonaccruing loans are included in average balances. Provision for Loan Losses The provision for loan losses charged against earnings was $150,000 in 2014, as compared to $1,450,000 in 2013 and $4,675,000 in 2012.
The decrease was a result of the analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses calculation, as well as improvement in asset quality including, nonaccrual loans decreasing by 22% and all
substandard loans decreasing by 5%. Each quarter, the Corporation assesses risk in the loan portfolio compared with the balance in the allowance for loan losses and the current evaluation factors. For
additional discussion of the provision and the loans associated therewith, please refer to the Asset Quality section of this
Management's Discussion and Analysis. ACNB charges confirmed loan losses to the allowance and credits the allowance for recoveries of previous loan charge-offs. For 2014, the Corporation had net
charge-offs of $1,069,000 as compared to net charge-offs of $2,184,000 for 2013. Other Income Other income was $11,904,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, a $201,000, or 1.7%, increase from 2013. Other income was
$11,703,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013, a $164,000, or 1.4%, decrease from 2012. The largest source of other income is commissions from insurance sales from RIG, which increased 3.6%
to $4,839,000 in 2014, decreased 3.4% to $4,671,000 in 2013. The increase in 2014 was due to higher contingent commission payments and a stabilization of customer commission income; the 2013 decrease
was due to lost customers in continued weak economic 38 Table of Contents conditions
and lower contingent commission payments from insurance carriers. These contingent, or extra, commissions are mostly received in March and April of each year, and the amount is at the
discretion of various insurance carriers in accordance with applicable insurance regulations. Heightened pressure on commissions is expected to continue in this business line, and contingent
commissions are not predictable. In
2014, a gain of $62,000 was recognized on sold or called securities compared to no gains or losses in 2013, and gains of $7,000 in 2012. Securities were sold in all periods to balance
state and local geographic mix. Income from fiduciary activities, which includes fees from both institutional and personal trust and investment management services and estate settlement services,
totaled $1,418,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to $1,299,000 for 2013 and $1,224,000 for 2012. At December 31, 2014, ACNB had total assets under administration of
approximately $165,000,000, compared to $151,000,000 at the end of 2013 and $141,000,000 at the end of 2012. The variations in income were in part due to more assets under management and the result of
higher estate settlement income in 2014 which varies with specific activity. Service
charges on deposit accounts decreased 5.7% to $2,118,000, after decreasing 7.7% in 2013, based upon varying customer actions that affect the volume of fees. Further, certain
government regulations and policies effective since 2010 limited service charge increases and make future revenue levels uncertain. Revenue from ATM and debit card transactions increased 8.1% to
$1,550,000 due to higher volume. The increase resulted from consumer desire to use more electronic delivery channels; however, regulations or legal challenges for large financial institutions may
impact industry pricing for such transactions and fees in connection therewith in future periods, the effect of which cannot be currently quantified. Another more recent threat to this revenue source
is the security breaches in the merchant base that are negatively affecting consumer confidence in the debit card channel. Fee income from sold mortgages decreased by $217,000, or 50.5%, to $213,000
in 2014 as new originations markedly decreased with increased interest rates in the first half of 2014. This revenue source is projected to continue at lower than normal levels in 2015 due to national
and local economic trends. Impairment Testing RIG has certain long-lived assets, including purchased intangible assets subject to amortization such as insurance books of business,
and associated goodwill assets, which are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying
amount of an asset exceeds its future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds
the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the statement of condition and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and
are no longer depreciated. Goodwill,
which has an indefinite useful life, is evaluated for impairment annually and is evaluated for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset
might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset's fair value. Recent changes to accounting rules permit an entity to first assess
qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The goodwill impairment analysis currently used by the
Corporation is a two-step test. The first step, used to identify potential impairment, involves comparing the reporting unit's estimated fair value to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the
estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, there is an indication of
potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment. If required, the second step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit
for which the first step indicated potential impairment. The implied fair value of 39 Table of Contents goodwill
is determined in a manner similar to the amount of goodwill calculated in a business combination, by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to a group of
likely buyers whose cash flow estimates could differ from those of the reporting entity, as determined in the first step, over the aggregate estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities
and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the
reporting unit, there is no impairment. If the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for the
excess. Subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted. During
the quarter ended June 30, 2012, the Corporation changed its method of applying ASC Topic 350 such that the annual goodwill impairment testing date was changed from
December 31 to October 1. This new testing date is preferable in the circumstances, because it allows the Corporation more time to accurately complete its impairment testing process, in
order to incorporate the results in the annual consolidated financial statements. As
noted above, commissions from insurance sales were up 3.6% in 2014, and RIG's stand alone net income increased 24.8% in 2014 compared to 2013 because of expense controls. The testing
for potential impairment involves methods that include both current and projected income amounts, and RIG's fair value remained above the carrying value as of the most recent annual impairment test
date. Thus, the results of the annual evaluations determined that there was no impairment of goodwill, including the testing at October 1, 2014. However, declines in RIG's net income or changes
in external market factors, including likely buyers that are assumed in impairment testing, may require an
impairment charge to goodwill. Should it be determined in a future period that the goodwill has been impaired, then a charge to earnings will be recorded in the period that such a determination is
made. Other Expenses Other expenses increased 0.8% to $32,264,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The largest component of other expenses is
salaries and employee benefits, which increased 3.0% in 2014 to $19,516,000 compared to $18,950,000 in 2013, and increased $397,000, or 2.1%, from 2012 to 2013. The reasons for the increase in
salaries and employee benefits expenses include the following:  staffing a new office plus other staff increases and higher skilled mix of employees necessitated by growth;  normal merit increases to employees and associated payroll taxes;  higher performance-based commissions and incentives;  higher employee benefit plan costs, including health insurance;  increases related to 401(k) plan and non-qualified retirement plan benefits; and,  offset, in part, by decreased defined benefit pension expense due to improved prior year plan investment performance and a higher than
recent years' discount rates (decreasing the liabilities for future obligations). The
Corporation reduced the benefit formula for the defined benefit pension plan effective January 1, 2010, in order to manage total benefit costs. Subsequently, the Corporation
amended the defined benefit pension plan effective April 1, 2012, in that no employee hired after March 31, 2012, shall be eligible to participate in the Plan and no inactive or former
plan participant shall be eligible to again participate in the Plan. The Corporation's overall pension plan investment strategy is to achieve a mix of investments to meet the long-term rate of return
assumption and near-term pension obligations with a diversification of asset types, fund strategies, and fund managers. The mix of investments is adjusted periodically by retaining an advisory firm to
recommend appropriate allocations after 40 Table of Contents reviewing
the Corporation's risk tolerance on contribution levels, funded status, plan expense, as well as any applicable regulatory requirements. However, the determination of future benefit expense
is also dependent on the fair value of assets and the discount rate on the year-end measurement date, which in recent years has experienced fair value volatility and low discount rates. The expense
will be higher in 2015 due to a lower discount rate at the latest measurement date, lower plan return in 2014, and change in mortality tables utilized. A pension provision in a public law known as
MAP-21, enacted in July 2012, had no effect on reducing the GAAP expense associated with the plan. In addition, the ACNB plan has maintained a well-funded status. Net
occupancy expense was up 4.8% at $2,050,000 in 2014, $1,957,000 in 2013, and $1,952,000 in 2012. Equipment expense totaled $2,768,000 during 2014, as compared to $2,826,000 during
2013 and $2,537,000 during 2012. Occupancy expense was up in 2014 due to a harsh winter season and additional locations; however, equipment expense decreased in 2014 due to the budgeted replacement of
outdated technology devices expensed in 2013, causing that year to be increased. Equipment expense is subject to ever increasing technology demands and the need for system upgrades for security and
reliability purposes, making the decrease in expense in 2014 outside the normal increased expense trend. Professional
services expense totaled $936,000 for 2014, as compared to $895,000 for 2013 and $825,000 for 2012. The variation in expense from year to year included varying legal costs
associated corporate governance, as well as the expense of heightened compliance monitoring on existing regulations and the expense of implementing new regulations including the Dodd-Frank Act. Other
tax expense decreased $164,000 or 18.2% in 2014 compared to 2013 due to a lower rate applied to the capital base at the Bank. Supplies and postage expense increased in 2014 compared to the prior year
due to outsourcing
that reduced other expense categories, otherwise 2013 decreased from the prior year due to customers' increased use of electronic channels. Marketing
and corporate relations expense increased 48.2% during 2014 due to product promotions and image expenditures. In 2013, this expense category was 6.5% higher than in 2012 due to
higher promotional and public relations expenditures. FDIC
and regulatory expense for 2014 was $748,000, a decrease of $20,000 from $768,000 in 2013. FDIC and regulatory expense in 2012 was $843,000. FDIC expense varies with changes in net
asset size, risk ratings, and FDIC derived assessment rates. Foreclosed
assets held for resale consist of the fair value of real estate acquired through foreclosure on real estate loan collateral or the acceptance of ownership of real estate in
lieu of the foreclosure process. Fair values are based on appraisals that consider the sales prices of similar properties in the proximate vicinity less estimated selling costs. Foreclosed real estate
expenses (income) were $346,000, $576,000 and $(119,000) for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The net recovery in 2012 was on two properties that sold for more
than the values after prior write-downs. The higher expense in 2013 and to a lesser extent in 2014 was a result of properties that suffered decreases in value after acquisition (requiring write-downs
to fair value) during prolonged marketing cycles for these distressed properties and, in some cases, during which the debtor remained in physical possession while eviction actions were contested and
finally executed. Values are written down based upon updated appraisals less selling costs (which in the often extended marketing periods can create multiple year expenses) and other fair value
adjustments, or in some cases properties are written down based on sales agreements that do not subsequently close. In all, the historically high costs consisted of these write-downs and other costs
to carry and was due to the increased number and varying mix of commercial and residential collateral for which such carrying costs include insurance, property maintenance, unpaid and ongoing property
taxes, and deferred maintenance required upon acquisition. Foreclosed real estate expenses will vary in 2015 depending on the successful closing of sales agreements on some existing properties and the
unknown expenses related to new properties acquired. 41 Table of Contents Other
operating expense decreased $197,000 or 5.6% in 2014 as a result of a one-time reduction of $272,000 associated with closing out two low-income housing projects. Otherwise,
increases were centered in upgrades in data channels and heightened corporate governance and risk management expenditures. Other operating expense increased 8.0% in 2013 from 2012 mainly as a result
of costs associated with corporate governance and communications. All periods include higher cost of the Bank's legal responsibility to reimburse customers in electronic transactions disputes even
when another party is at fault. Provision for Income Taxes ACNB recognized income taxes of $3,080,000, or 23.0% of pretax income, during 2014, as compared to $2,535,000, or 21.4%, during 2013
and $2,319,000, or 20.7%, during 2012. The variances from the federal statutory rate are generally due to tax-exempt income from investments in and loans to state and local units of government at
below-market rates (an indirect form of taxation), investment in bank-owned life insurance, and investments in low-income housing partnerships (which qualify for federal tax credits). Some tax-exempt
investments have been allowed to run off due to concerns of interest rate risk related to these investments, while a limited amount were sold to reduce the chance of future credit risk. The
increasing effective tax rate during 2014, 2013, and 2012 was a result of increasing pretax income in relationship to declining tax-exempt income. Pretax income increased in each
year due to revenue and expense elements described above. At
December 31, 2014, net deferred tax assets amounted to $1,512,000. Deferred tax assets are realizable primarily through future reversal of existing taxable temporary
differences and future earnings. Management currently anticipates future earnings and capital gains will be adequate to utilize deferred tax assets. Accordingly, no valuation allowance has been
established for deferred tax assets at December 31, 2014. FINANCIAL CONDITION Average earning assets increased in 2014 to $977,389,000, or by 1.2%, from $965,445,000 in 2013 following $963,885,000 in 2012. ACNB's
overnight interest bearing deposits and investment portfolio decreased in 2014 on average, as less funds were allocated into liquid short-term investment due to availability of borrowing based
liquidity. Investments decreased in 2014 as repayments and maturities were used to fund loan demand. Investments increased in 2013 from deposit growth. Loans increased 5.8% and 1.5% on average in 2014
and 2013, respectively. Growth in loans was funded by increased stable deposits, investment cash flow and term FHLB borrowings. Average deposits decreased less than 1.0% in 2014 to $817,725,000 from
$820,793,000 in 2013 and $807,694,000 in 2012. Average borrowings increased in 2014 to $125,441,000 from $108,495,000 in 2013 and $123,242,000 in 2012. Fluctuations in borrowings are term borrowing to
fund loan demand and variations in local customer repurchase accounts, which are akin to deposits. Investment Securities ACNB uses investment securities to generate interest and dividend income, manage interest rate risk, provide collateral for certain
funding products, and provide liquidity. The changes in the securities portfolio in 2014 were mainly to deploy available funds into the appropriate mix of earning assets. Investing into investment
security portfolio assets over the last several years was made more challenging due to the Federal Reserve's program commonly called Quantitative Easing in which, by the Federal Reserve's open market
purchases, the yields were maintained at a lower level than would otherwise be the case. The mix in the securities portfolio during 2014 was changed to deploy available funds into the appropriate mix
of earning assets. The investment portfolio is comprised of U.S. Government agency, 42 Table of Contents municipal,
and corporate securities. These securities provide the appropriate characteristics with respect to credit quality, yield and maturity relative to the management of the overall balance
sheet. At
December 31, 2014, the securities balance included a net unrealized gain on available for sale securities of $2,570,000, net of taxes, on amortized cost of $114,106,000 versus
a net unrealized gain of $2,572,000, net of taxes, on amortized cost of $126,090,000 at December 31, 2013. The change in fair value of available for sale securities during 2014 was a result of
a lower amount of investments in the available for sale portfolio, offset by a decrease in the U.S. Treasury yield curve rates and the spread from this yield curve required by investors on the types
of investment securities that ACNB owns. Even though Federal Reserve ceased their rate-decreasing Quantitative Easing program in 2014, events in the domestic and international economies caused
interest rates to continue to contract. Previously, actions by the Federal Reserve to lower rates on the yield curve most conducive to stimulating the housing market and to boost employment and
consumption were offset the bond markets' concern about the level of U.S. debt and inflation, leading to generally higher rates on the yield curve at the end of 2013. However, fair values were
volatile on any given day in 2014 and such volatility will continue. At
December 31, 2014, the securities balance included held to maturity securities with an amortized cost of $73,346,000 and a fair value of $73,057,000, as compared to an
amortized cost of $94,373,000 and a fair value of $92,082,000 at December 31, 2013. The held to maturity securities are U.S. government agency debentures and pass-through mortgage-backed
securities in which the full payment of principal and interest is guaranteed; however, they are not classified as available for sale because of prevailing low interest rates at purchase, therefore
these securities are projected not to be practicable to sell for liquidity needs in future periods. These securities are generally used as required collateral for certain eligible government accounts
or repurchase agreements. They are also held for possible pledging to
access additional liquidity for banking subsidiary needs in the form of Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings. The
Corporation does not own investments consisting of pools of Alt A or subprime mortgages, private label mortgage-backed securities, or trust preferred investments. The
fair values of securities available for sale (carried at fair value) are determined by obtaining quoted market prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges (Level 1)
or by matrix pricing (Level 2), which is a mathematical technique used widely in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted market prices for the specific
security but rather by relying on the security's relationship to other benchmark quoted prices. The Corporation uses independent service providers to provide matrix pricing. Please refer to

are at amortized cost. Mortgage-backed securities are allocated based upon scheduled maturities. Loans Year over year, loans outstanding increased by $70,624,000, or 9.7%, in 2014, as compared to 2.9% growth experienced in 2013, both
years demonstrating the determined efforts to lend to creditworthy borrowers subject to the Corporation's disciplined underwriting standards despite the continued slow economic conditions and intense
competition. The higher increase in 2014 was created by concerted efforts to produce new loans whereas several payoffs of large local and participated loans produced a lower increase in 2013. Within
the portfolio, the higher growth was centered in increased commercial purpose loans/commercial construction loans, while lower growth was in local market residential mortgages. The commercial purpose
segments increased $58,034,000, or 19.5%, during 2014, spread among diverse categories that include farmland secured, loans to local government units, and other 44 Table of Contents types
of commercial lending. Residential real estate mortgage lending, which includes smaller commercial purpose loans secured by the owner's home, increased by $10,487,000, or 2.6%, to local
borrowers who preferred loan types that would not be sold into the secondary mortgage market. Of the $10,487,000 increase, $2,900,000 were residential mortgage loans secured by junior liens or home
equity loans, which are also in many cases junior liens. Junior liens inherently have more credit risk by virtue of the fact that another financial institution may have a senior security position in
the case of foreclosure liquidation of collateral to extinguish the debt. Generally, foreclosure actions could become more prevalent if the real estate market weakens, property values deteriorate, or
rates increase sharply. Real estate construction loans increased in 2014, up $1,014,000, or 9.1%, as a result of some stabilization in the residential real estate market despite stricter underwriting
on this loan type due to the category's credit attributes. The
residential real estate category was higher in 2013 compared to 2012 as the result of more concentrated efforts to book consumer loans secured by real estate. In 2013, commercial
lending staff concentrated in maintaining business lending outstandings despite reduced business activity in the market area that hindered new originations, as well as management's decision to not
renew certain commercial loans, primarily participation credits in conjunction with other financial institutions, due to perceived potential credit risk.

of the Corporation's lending activities are with customers located within southcentral Pennsylvania and in the northern Maryland area that is contiguous to its Pennsylvania retail
banking offices. This region currently and historically has lower unemployment than the U.S. as a whole. Included in commercial real estate loans are loans made to lessors of non-residential
properties that total $123,422,000, or 15.4% of total loans, at December 31, 2014. These borrowers are geographically dispersed throughout ACNB's marketplace and are leasing commercial
properties to a varied group of tenants including medical offices, retail space, and other commercial purpose facilities. Because of the varied nature of the tenants, in aggregate, management believes
that these loans present an acceptable risk when compared to commercial loans in general. ACNB does not originate or hold Alt-A or subprime mortgages in its loan portfolio. Asset Quality The ACNB loan portfolio is subject to varying degrees of credit risk. Credit risk is mitigated through prudent underwriting standards,
ongoing credit review, and monitoring and reporting asset quality measures. Additionally, loan portfolio diversification, limiting exposure to a single industry or borrower, and requiring collateral
also reduces ACNB's credit risk. ACNB's
commercial, consumer and residential mortgage loans are principally to borrowers in southcentral Pennsylvania and northern Maryland. As the majority of ACNB's loans are located in
this area, a substantial portion of the debtor's ability to honor the obligation may be affected by the level of economic activity in the market area. Although
materially elevated from several years back, the unemployment rate in ACNB's market area remained below the state and national average during 2014. Additionally, low interest
rates, a less volatile local economy, and minimal inflation continued to provide some support to the economic conditions in the area. During 2014, continued contraction in new residential real estate
development/construction and general lower economic activity lingered from the recent major recession, challenging the Corporation's marketplace commercial activity. Slower growth areas such as ACNB's
marketplace generally do not retract in economic recessions as quickly and as low as other areas of the country, however the recovery from low economic cycles are also generally slower. Non-performing
assets include nonaccrual loans and restructured loans (troubled debt restructures or TDRs), accruing loans past due 90 days or more, and other foreclosed assets.
The accrual of interest on residential mortgage and commercial loans (consisting of commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, and commercial real estate construction loan categories) is
discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days past due unless the credit is well secured and in the process of collection. Consumer loans (consisting of home equity lines of credit and consumer
loan categories) are typically charged off no 46 Table of Contents later
than 120 days past due. Past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged off at an earlier date if collection of
principal or interest is considered doubtful. ACNB occasionally returns nonaccrual loans to performing status when the borrower brings the loan current and performs in accordance with contractual
terms for a reasonable period of time. ACNB categorizes a loan as a TDR if it changes the terms of the loan, such as interest rate, repayment schedule or both, to terms that it otherwise would not
have granted to a borrower, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower's financial difficulties. The
following table sets forth the Corporation's non-performing assets as of the end of the years indicated: Table 7Non-Performing Assets Dollars in thousands 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 Nonaccrual loans, including TDRs $ 6,648 $ 8,573 $ 6,327 $ 12,846 $ 14,657 Accruing loans 90 days past due 1,636 1,926 771 1,191 997 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Non-Performing Loans 8,284 10,499 7,098 14,037 15,654 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Foreclosed assets 1,617 1,762 4,247 4,437 7,859 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Non-Performing Assets $ 9,901 $ 12,261 $ 11,345 $ 18,474 $ 23,513 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Accruing Troubled Debt Restructurings $ 6,968 $ 7,139 $ 4,815 $  $  ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Ratios: Non-performing loans to total loans 1.04 % 1.44 % 1.00 % 2.02 % 2.35 % Non-performing assets to total assets 0.91 % 1.17 % 1.08 % 1.84 % 2.43 % Allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans 183.15 % 153.26 % 237.04 % 110.29 % 97.43 % If
interest due on all nonaccrual loans had been accrued at original contract rates, it is estimated that income before income taxes would have been greater by $570,000 in 2014, $704,000
in 2013, and $543,000 in 2012. The decrease in nonaccrual loans from 2013 to 2014 is discussed further below. Impaired
loans at December 31, 2014 and 2013, totaled $13,616,000 and $15,712,000, respectively. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, $866,000 and $2,036,000, respectively, of
the impaired loans were troubled debt restructured loans, which were also classified as nonaccrual. $6,968,000 and $7,139,000 of the impaired loans were accruing troubled debt restructured loans at
December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Loans whose terms are modified are classified as troubled debt restructurings if the borrowers have been granted concessions and it is deemed that
those borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty. Concessions granted under a troubled debt restructuring generally involve interest rates being granted below current market rates for the credit
risk of the loan or an extension of a loan's stated maturity date. Nonaccrual troubled debt restructurings are restored to accrual status if principal and interest payments, under the modified terms,
are current for six consecutive months after modification. Loans classified as troubled debt restructurings are designated as impaired. The related allowance for loan losses on impaired loans totaled
$302,000 and $201,000 at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decrease in accruing troubled debt restructurings was due to payments made. The decrease in nonaccrual loans was related
to customer payments made and complete payoffs exceeding new non-accrual loans added in 2014 (most with adequate real estate collateral), net of other loan amounts that were charged-off. Further
discussion on nonaccrual loans is included below in a separate discussion on nonaccrual loans. Potential problem loans are defined as performing loans that have characteristics that cause management
to have doubts as to the ability of the borrower to perform under present loan repayment terms and which may result in the reporting of these loans as non-performing loans in the future. Total
additional potential problem loans approximated $9,896,000 at December 31, 2014, compared to $9,083,000 at December 31, 2013. 47 Table of Contents Foreclosed
assets held for resale consists of the fair value of real estate acquired through foreclosure on real estate loan collateral or the acceptance of ownership of such real estate
in lieu of the foreclosure process. Fair values are based on appraisals that consider the sale prices of similar properties in the proximate vicinity less estimated selling costs. Foreclosed assets
held for resale totaled $1,617,000 at December 31, 2014. Seven unrelated commercial use or construction real estate properties were brought into foreclosed real estate in 2014, 2013, 2012, or
2010 with an aggregate fair value of $1,199,000. In addition, the fair value of $418,000 for foreclosed real estate at December 31, 2014, represented five residential real estate single family
homes, which were taken into foreclosed real estate
in 2014. All properties are being actively marketed to targeted buyers by external and internal resources. The total of $1,762,000 in foreclosed real estate at December 31, 2013, represented
six commercial use or construction real estate properties, and three single family homes. Allowance for Loan Losses ACNB maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level believed to be adequate by management to absorb potential losses in the loan
portfolio, and it is funded through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. On a quarterly basis, ACNB utilizes a defined methodology in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan
losses, which considers specific credit reviews, past loan losses, historical experience, and qualitative factors. This methodology results in an allowance that is considered appropriate in light of
the high degree of judgment required and that is prudent and conservative, but not excessive. Management
assigns internal risk ratings for each commercial lending relationship. Utilizing historical loss experience, adjusted for changes in trends, conditions and other relevant
factors, management derives estimated losses for non-rated and non-classified loans. When management identifies impaired loans with uncertain collectability of principal and interest, it evaluates a
specific reserve on a quarterly basis in order to estimate potential losses. Management's analysis considers:  adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay;  the current estimated fair value of underlying collateral; and,  prevailing market conditions. If
management determines a loan is not impaired, a specific reserve allocation is not required. Management then places the loan in a pool of loans with similar risk factors and assigns
the general loss factor to determine the reserve. For homogeneous loan types, such as consumer and residential mortgage loans, management bases specific allocations on the average loss ratio for the
previous three years for each specific loan pool. Additionally, management adjusts projected loss ratios for other factors, including the following:  lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and collection, charge-off, and recovery practices;  national, regional, and local economic and business conditions, as well as the condition of various market segments, including the
impact on the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans;  nature and volume of the portfolio and terms of loans;  experience, ability and depth of lending management and staff;  volume and severity of past due, classified and nonaccrual loans, as well as other loan modifications; and,  existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations. 48 Table of Contents Management determines the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses, which represents the difference between the reported allowance for loan losses and
the calculated allowance for loan losses, based on the following criteria:  risk of imprecision in the specific and general reserve allocations;  the perceived level of consumer and small business loans with demonstrated weaknesses for which it is not practicable to develop
specific allocations;  other potential exposure in the loan portfolio;  variances in management's assessment of national, regional, and local economic conditions; and,  other internal or external factors that management believes appropriate at that time. The
unallocated portion of the allowance is deemed to be appropriate as it reflects an uncertainty that remains in the loan portfolio; specifically reserves where the Corporation
believes that tertiary losses are probable above the loss amount derived using appraisal-based loss estimation, where such additional loss estimates are in accordance with regulatory and GAAP
guidance. Appraisal-based loss derivation does not fully develop the loss present in certain unique, ultimately bank-owned collateral. The Corporation has determined that the amount of provision in
2014 and the resulting allowance at December 31, 2014, are appropriate given the level of risk in the loan portfolio. Further, management believes the unallocated allowance is appropriate,
although the impaired loans added in 2014 demonstrate generally low risk because of adequate real estate collateral, the value of such collateral can decrease; plus, the growth in the loan portfolio
is centered around commercial real estate which continues to have little increase in value and low liquidity. In addition, there are certain loans that, although they did not meet the criteria for
impairment, management believes there was a strong possibility that these loans represented probable losses at December 31, 2014. Management
believes the above methodology accurately reflects losses inherent in the portfolio. Management charges actual loan losses to the allowance for loan losses. Management
periodically updates the methodology and the assumptions discussed above. Management
bases the provision for loan losses, or lack of provision, on the overall analysis taking into account the methodology discussed above. The provision for 2014 was $1,300,000
less than the provision for 2013. The provision for 2013 was $3,225,000 less than the provision for 2012. Management believes that the decrease in the provision reflects that potential losses inherent
in the portfolio were reflected in previous period provision expense and is consistent with recent improving credit quality in the loan portfolio. Federal
and state regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Corporation's allowance for loan losses and may require the Corporation
to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination, which may not be currently available to management. Based on
management's comprehensive analysis of the loan portfolio and economic conditions, management believes the current level of the allowance for loan losses is adequate. 49 Table of Contents The

nonaccrual impaired loans are to borrowers located within the market area served by the Corporation in southcentral Pennsylvania and nearby areas of northern Maryland. All nonaccrual
impaired loans were originated by ACNB's banking subsidiary, except for one participation loan discussed below, between 1995 and 2012 for purposes listed in the classifications in the table above. Included
in commercial real estate construction at December 31, 2014, the Corporation had one impaired and nonaccrual loan of $274,000 to finance a project in the Corporation's
primary trading area of southcentral Pennsylvania. The loan had standard terms and conditions including repayment from the sales of the respective properties and no interest reserves, and was
originated during the first half of 2006. Foreclosure has been held in abeyance while allowing the pursuit of a workout plan. The workout plan resulted in payments of $420,000 in 2014. One smaller
commercial real estate construction loan, added in 2010, was reduced by collateral sales to $94,000, which is supported by the remaining collateral's current fair value. Owner
occupied commercial real estate and construction includes 12 unrelated loan relationships, all of which but a loan relationship for farmland have balances of less than $850,000
each, for which the real estate is collateral and is used in connection with a business enterprise that is suffering economic stress or is out of business. A farmland relationship with an outstanding
balance of $849,000, with normal terms and conditions, was added to nonaccrual in the second quarter of 2013 after the loan matured and the borrower commenced a bankruptcy filing. Based on recent
appraisals, the loan appears to be adequately collateralized and some principal payments are being made. The other loans in this category were originated between 1995 and 2010 and are business loans
impacted by the general economic downturn that has not recovered. Collection efforts will continue until it is deemed in the best interest of the Corporation to initiate foreclosure procedures. Investment/rental
residential real estate includes three unrelated loan relationships totaling $1,226,000 for which the real estate is collateral and the purpose of which is for
speculation, rental, or other non-owner occupied uses; of which one loan was approximately $508,000, originated in 2009 with normal terms and conditions. The credit was deemed nonaccrual impaired in
the first quarter of 2013 51 Table of Contents and
had a specific allocation and subsequent partial charge-off to arrive at the fair value. This property will be converted to foreclosed assets held for resale in the first quarter 2015 upon receipt
of legal title. One loan with a balance of $694,000 had a specific allocation of $302,000 based on appraisal less estimated costs to sell. Included
in impaired commercial and industrial loans is a participation loan with standard terms and conditions including repayment from conversion of trade assets for a business in
southcentral Pennsylvania in Chapter 11 bankruptcy that has a balance of $1,683,000. This loan was moved to nonaccrual in the third quarter of 2014 after becoming delinquent with no indication
of when regular payments would resume. Besides trade assets, the loan is fully guaranteed by a government sponsored entity so no specific allocation was deemed to be necessary. The
Corporation utilizes a systematic review of its loan portfolio on a quarterly basis in order to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. In addition, ACNB engages the
services of an outside independent loan review function and sets the timing and coverage of loan reviews during the year. The results of this independent loan review are included in the systematic
review of the loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses consists of a component for individual loan impairment, primarily based on the loan's collateral fair value and expected cash flow. A watch
list of loans is identified for evaluation based on internal and external loan grading and reviews. Loans other than those determined to be impaired are grouped into pools of loans with similar credit
risk characteristics. These loans are evaluated as groups with allocations made to the allowance based on historical loss experience adjusted for current trends in delinquencies, trends in
underwriting and oversight, concentrations of credit, and general economic conditions within the Corporation's trading area. The provision expense was based on the loans discussed above, as well as
current trends in the watch list and the local economy as a whole. The charge-offs discussed elsewhere in this Management's Discussion and Analysis create the recent loss history experience and result
in the qualitative adjustment which, in turn, affects the calculation of losses inherent in the portfolio. The provision for loan losses for 2014 compared to 2013 and 2012 was a result of the
measurement of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at each period. The decrease in the provision was also a result of the analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. More
specifically, nonaccrual loans decreased and provision expense decreased due to the amount of the allowance necessary in proportion to substandard loans in accordance with management's belief that
adequate collateralization generally exists for substandard loans in accordance with GAAP. Each quarter, the Corporation assesses risk in the loan portfolio compared with the balance in the allowance
for loan losses and the current evaluation factors. Foreclosed Assets Held for Resale The carrying value of real estate acquired through foreclosure was $1,617,000 at December 31, 2014, compared to $1,762,000 at
December 31, 2013. The decrease was mainly due to four properties that were disposed of in 2014. Three additional commercial properties were added in 2010 through 2013 that remain unsold at
December 31, 2014, with an aggregate fair value of $1,008,000. Three unrelated commercial properties totaling $191,000 and five residential properties totaling $418,000 were added in 2014 and
remain unsold at December 31, 2014. All properties are actively being marketed. The Corporation expects to obtain and market additional foreclosed assets in 2015; however, the total amount and
timing is currently not certain. Other Assets Other assets decreased $562,000, or 2.7%, in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily because of a decrease in the Bank's pension plan,
including the related deferred tax effect due to the change in discount rate, rate of return, and change in mortality assumptions in 2014. 52 Table of Contents Deposits ACNB relies on deposits as the primary source of funds for lending activities. Average deposits decreased 0.4%, or $3,068,000, during
2014, as compared to a 1.6% increase during 2013. ACNB's deposit pricing function employs a disciplined pricing approach based upon alternative funding rates, but also strives to price deposits to be
competitive with relevant local competition, including credit unions and larger regional banks. The 2014 average deposit decrease in part was a return to more normal conditions after several years
experienced a shift to transaction accounts as customers put more value in liquidity and FDIC insurance. Products, such as money market accounts and interest-bearing transaction accounts that had
suffered declines in past years, continued with recovered balances while retail time deposits decreased. Year-end 2013 to year-end 2014 recorded an increase in deposits of $44,233,000, or 5.5%, most
of which was in large local government non maturity and time deposits, as such funds typically are held for liquidity by those agencies or a no risk alternative to other currently low rate
investments. With persistent low market interest rates in a slow economy, ACNB's ability to maintain and add to its deposit base may be impacted by the reluctance of consumers to accept low rates and
by competition willing to pay above market rates to attract market share. Alternatively, if rates rise rapidly and the equity markets continue to improve, funds could leave the Corporation or be
priced higher to maintain deposits. Table 10Time Deposits Maturities of time deposits of $100,000 or more outstanding at December 31, 2014, are summarized as follows: In thousands Three months or less $ 27,308 Over three through six months 14,451 Over six through twelve months 18,581 Over twelve months 29,341 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total $ 89,681 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Borrowings Short-term borrowings are comprised primarily of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and short-term borrowings from the
Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB). As of December 31, 2014, short-term borrowings were $45,699,000, a decrease of $3,353,000, or 6.8%, from the December 31, 2013, balance of $49,052,000.
Agreements to repurchase accounts are within the commercial customer base and have attributes similar to core deposits. Investment securities are pledged in sufficient amounts to collateralize these
agreements. Compared to year-end 2013, repurchase agreement balances were up due to normal fluctuations in the business activities of ACNB's commercial customer base. At December 31, 2014,
there were $0 in short-term FHLB borrowings, due to daily fluctuation in deposits and loans. Long-term borrowings consist primarily of longer-term advances from the FHLB that provides term funding of
loan assets and contribute to a more balanced net repricing position. In addition, such borrowings include a $1.4 million loan from a commercial bank to fund the initial purchase of RIG.
Long-term borrowings totaled $80,937,000 at December 31, 2014, versus $82,703,000 at December 31, 2013. The Corporation decreased long-term borrowings 2.1% as funding for loan demand was
available from other sources. Generally however, as term advances matured, new laddered FHLB fixed-rate term advances were taken in 2014 to reduce net liability sensitivity and to take advantage of
lower rates. Further borrowings will be used when necessary for a variety of risk management and funding purposes. Please refer to the Liquidity discussion below for more information on the Corporation's ability to borrow. 53 Table of Contents The
following tables set forth information about the Corporation's borrowings as of the dates indicated: In thousands 2014 2013 2012 Short-term borrowings outstanding at end of year: FHLB overnight advance $  $ 6,800 $  Securities sold under repurchase agreements 45,699 42,252 47,303 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total $ 45,699 $ 49,052 $ 47,303 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Dollars in thousands 2014 2013 2012 Average interest rate at year-end 0.14 % 0.14 % 0.14 % Maximum amount outstanding at any month-end $ 74,846 $ 76,333 $ 58,343 Average amount outstanding $ 44,399 $ 53,184 $ 48,300 Weighted average interest rate 0.14 % 0.11 % 0.16 % Capital ACNB's capital management strategies have been developed to provide an appropriate rate of return, in the opinion of management, to
stockholders, while maintaining its "well capitalized" position in relationship to its risk exposure. Total stockholders' equity was $110,022,000 at December 31, 2014, compared to $106,802,000
at December 31, 2013. Stockholders' equity increased during 2014 , a net result of earnings retained in capital during 2014, and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income resulting
from amounts associated with the pension plan, and the change in fair value of the assets in the available for sale investment portfolio. The
primary source of additional capital to ACNB is earnings retention, which represents net income less dividends declared. During 2014, ACNB retained $5,668,000, or 55.1%, of its net
income, as compared to $4,773,000, or 51.2%, in 2013 and $4,362,000, or 49.1%, in 2012. ACNB
Corporation has a Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan that provides registered holders of ACNB Corporation common stock with a convenient way to purchase additional shares
of common stock by permitting participants in the plan to automatically reinvest cash dividends on all or a portion of the shares owned and to make quarterly voluntary cash payments under the terms of
the plan. Participation in the plan is voluntary, and there are eligibility requirements to participate in the plan. Cumulative to December 31, 2014, 87,307 shares were issued under this plan
with proceeds in the amount of $1,380,000. Proceeds are used for general corporate purposes. ACNB
is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and
possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on ACNB. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt
corrective action, ACNB must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory
accounting practices. The capital amounts and reclassifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. Quantitative
measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require ACNB to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and Tier 1 capital to average assets.
Management believes, as of
December 31, 2014 and 2013, that ACNB's banking subsidiary met all minimum capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject and is categorized as "well capitalized". There are no subsequent
conditions or events that management believes have changed the banking subsidiary's category. 54 Table of Contents Regulatory Capital Changes In July 2013, the federal banking agencies issued final rules to implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and changes
required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The phase-in period for community banking organizations begins January 1, 2015, while larger institutions (generally those with assets of $250 billion or
more) were required to begin compliance effective January 1, 2014. The final rules call for the following capital requirements:  a minimum ratio of common Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5%;  a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6.0%;  a minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%, which is no change from the current rule; and,  a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%. In
addition, the final rules establish a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets applicable to all banking organizations. If a banking
organization fails to hold capital above the minimum capital ratios and the capital conservation buffer, it will be subject to certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus
payments. The phase-in period for the capital conservation and countercyclical capital buffers for all banking organizations will begin on January 1, 2016. Under
the proposed rules, accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) would have been included in a banking organization's common equity Tier 1 capital. The final rules allow
community banks to make a one-time election not to include these additional components of AOCI in regulatory capital and instead use the existing treatment under the general risk-based capital rules
that excludes most AOCI components from regulatory capital. The opt-out election must be made in the first call report or FR Y-9 series report that is filed after the financial institution becomes
subject to the final rule. The
final rules permanently grandfather non-qualifying capital instruments (such as trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock) issued before May 19,
2010, for inclusion in the Tier 1 capital of banking organizations with total consolidated assets of less than $15 billion as of December 31, 2009, and banking organizations that
were mutual holding companies as of May 19, 2010. The
proposed rules would have modified the risk-weight framework applicable to residential mortgage exposures to require banking organizations to divide residential mortgage exposures
into two categories in order to determine the applicable risk weight. In response to commenter concerns about the burden of calculating the risk weights and the potential negative effect on credit
availability, the final rules do not adopt the proposed risk weights, but retain the current risk weights for mortgage exposures under the general risk-based capital rules. Consistent
with the Dodd-Frank Act, the new rules replace the ratings-based approach to securitization exposures, which is based on external credit ratings, with the simplified
supervisory formula approach in order to determine the appropriate risk weights for these exposures. Alternatively, banking organizations may use the existing gross-up approach to assign
securitization exposures to a risk weight category or choose to assign such exposures a 1,250 percent risk weight. Under
the new rules, mortgage servicing assets and certain deferred tax assets are subject to stricter limitations than those applicable under the current general risk-based capital
rule. The new rules also increase the risk weights for past due loans, certain commercial real estate loans, and some equity exposures, and makes selected other changes in risk weights and credit
conversion factors. The
Corporation has assessed the impact of these changes on the regulatory ratios of the Corporation and the banking subsidiary, as well as on the capital, operations, liquidity, and
earnings of 55 Table of Contents the
Corporation and the banking subsidiary and concluded that the new rules will not have a material negative effect. Table 11Risk-Based Capital The banking subsidiary's capital ratios are as follows: 2014 2013 To be Well Capitalized under Prompt Corrective Action Regulations Tier 1 leverage ratio (to average assets) 8.86 % 8.76 % 5.00 % Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio (to risk-weighted assets) 12.75 % 12.99 % 6.00 % Total risk-based capital ratio 14.01 % 14.26 % 10.00 % For
further information on the actual and required capital amounts and ratios, please refer to Note N"Regulatory Matters" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. Liquidity Effective liquidity management ensures the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, as well as the operating cash needs of
ACNB, are met. ACNB's
funds are available from a variety of sources, including assets that are readily convertible such as interest bearing deposits with banks, maturities and repayments from the
securities portfolio, scheduled repayments of loans receivable, the core deposit base, and the ability to borrow from the FHLB. At December 31, 2014, ACNB could borrow approximately
$456,258,000 from the FHLB of which $376,758,000 was available. Because of various restrictions and requirements on utilizing the available balance, ACNB considers $283,000,000 to be the practicable
additional borrowing capacity, which is considered to be sufficient for operational needs. The FHLB system is self-capitalizing, member-owned, and its member banks' stock is not publicly traded. ACNB
creates its borrowing capacity with the FHLB by granting a security interest in certain loan assets with requisite credit quality. ACNB has reviewed information on the FHLB system and the FHLB of
Pittsburgh, and has concluded that they have the capacity and intent to continue to provide both operational and contingency liquidity. The FHLB of Pittsburgh instituted a requirement that a member's
investment securities must be moved into a safekeeping account under FHLB control to be considered in the calculation of maximum borrowing capacity. The Corporation currently has securities in
safekeeping at the FHLB of Pittsburgh; however, the safekeeping account is under the Corporation's control. As better contingent liquidity is maintained by keeping the securities under the
Corporation's control, the Corporation has not moved the securities which, in effect, lowered the Corporation's maximum borrowing capacity. However, there is no practical reduction in borrowing
capacity as the securities can be moved into the FHLB-controlled account promptly if they are needed for borrowing purposes. Another
source of liquidity is securities sold under repurchase agreements to customers of ACNB's banking subsidiary totaling $45,699,000 and $42,252,000 at December 31, 2014 and
2013, respectively. The
liquidity of the parent company also represents an important aspect of liquidity management. The parent company's cash outflows consist principally of dividends to stockholders and
corporate expenses. The main source of funding for the parent company is the dividends it receives from its subsidiaries. Federal and state banking regulations place certain legal restrictions and
other practicable safety and soundness restrictions on dividends paid to the parent company from the subsidiary bank. For a discussion of ACNB's dividend restrictions, please refer to
Item 1"Business" and
Note J"Regulatory Restrictions on Dividends" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 56 Table of Contents ACNB
manages liquidity by monitoring projected cash inflows and outflows on a daily basis, and believes it has sufficient funding sources to maintain sufficient liquidity under varying
degrees of business conditions. Aggregate Contractual Obligations The following table represents the Corporation's on- and off-balance sheet aggregate contractual obligations to make future payments as
of December 31, 2014: In thousands Less than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 4 - 5 Years Over 5 Years Total Time deposits $ 156,329 $ 88,623 $ 6,975 $  $ 251,927 Short-term borrowings 45,699    45,699 Long-term debt 21,281 33,110 26,546  80,937 Operating leases 381 403 279 317 1,380 Payments under nonqualified benefit plans(1) 100 244 282 6,323 6,949 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total $ 223,790 $ 122,380 $ 34,082 $ 6,640 $ 386,892 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (1) The
payments under nonqualified benefit plans excludes expected benefit retirement payments that will be paid from plan assets. In
addition, the Corporation, in the conduct of business operations, routinely enters into contracts for services and equipment. These contracts may require payment to be provided in the
future, and may also contain penalty clauses for early termination of the contracts. Major expenditures are controlled by various approval authorities. Management is not aware of any other commitments
or contingent liabilities which may have a material adverse impact on the liquidity or capital resources of the Corporation. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Corporation is party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing
needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and, to a lesser extent, standby letters of credit. At December 31, 2014, the Corporation had unfunded
outstanding commitments to extend credit of $217,837,000 and outstanding standby letters of credit of $6,072,000. Because these commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and many will expire
without being drawn upon, the total commitment level does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Please refer to Note O"Financial Instruments with Off-balance Sheet
Risk" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the nature, business purpose, and importance of the Corporation's off-balance sheet arrangements.
