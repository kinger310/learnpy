I ITEM 1. BUSINESS Business Overview We are an electronic cigarette company
with Internet sales and kiosk locations in the greater Miami area through our fully owned subsidiary A1 Vapors, Inc., which was
incorporated in April 2012 as a Florida Corporation. A1 Vapors is a product development and marketing company catering to the electronic
vapor cigarette and accessories industry. A1 Vapors offers a variety of options to choose from to appeal to all smokers including
a diverse selection of devices and flavors. “Electronic cigarettes”
or “e-cigarettes” and “vaporizers” are battery-powered products that enable users to inhale nicotine vapor
without smoke, tar, ash, or carbon monoxide. Electronic cigarettes look like traditional cigarettes and, regardless of their construction
are comprised of three functional components: · A mouthpiece, which is a small plastic
cartridge that contains a liquid nicotine solution; · The heating element that vaporizes the
liquid nicotine so that it can be inhaled; and · The electronics, which include: a lithium-ion
battery, an airflow sensor, a microchip controller and an LED which illuminates to indicate use. When a user draws air through the electronic
cigarette and or vaporizer, the air flow is detected by a sensor, which activates a heating element that vaporizes the solution
stored in the mouthpiece/cartridge, the solution is then vaporized and it is this vapor that is inhaled by the user. The cartridge
contains either a nicotine solution or a nicotine free solution, either which may be flavored. The Company was engaged in the business
of operating sweepstakes websites featuring free giveaways of premier consumer products to users who participated in online games.
Prior to this the Company was offering window blind system products and ceased such operation upon the consummation of a change
of control of the Company in August 2012. Since August 2012, and until mid-August 2014, management had been building the Company
to be a platform for marketing and advertising initiatives and a marketplace for consumer products. On August 14, 2014 the Company
entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with A-1 Vapors, Inc. as reported in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on August 22, 2014 (the “August 2014 Form 8-K”). The Company is now involved
in the electronic cigarette retail market. The Company has filed an Amendment to
the Articles of Incorporation as reported in the 8-K file on January 16, 2015 requesting the state of Nevada and FINRA change its
name from “FreeButton, Inc.” to the new name “A1 Group, Inc.” All of the Company’s filings will reflect
the new name when the process is completed with the state and federal agencies. Corporate History The Company was incorporated on November 27,
2006 under the laws of the State of Nevada and extra-provincially registered under the laws of the Province of Ontario on February
2, 2007. On September 28, 2012, the Company with a majority of the shareholders and directors changed its name from Secured Window
Blinds, Inc. to Freebutton, Inc. On June 23, 2014 a majority of the shareholders and directors and on November 23, 2014 changed
its name from Freebutton, Inc. to A1 Group, Inc. A1 Group, Inc. is now a product development
and marketing company catering to the electronic vapor cigarette and accessories industry. 1 Recent Developments On
May 23, 2014, FreeButton, Inc. (now known as A1 Group, Inc.) entered into an Exchange Agreement with A-1 Vapors, Inc., to acquire
A-1 Vapors. The transaction contemplated by the Exchange Agreement was consummated on August 14, 2014. As reported in our From
8-K filed with the SEC on August 22, 2014, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the ‘Share Exchange Agreement”)
which resulted in a Reverse Takeover with selling stockholders named in the prospectus, pursuant to which the Company offered and
sold an aggregate of 21,000,000 shares of common stock to all the stockholders of A-1 Vapors,, Inc., a Florida corporation (“A-1
Vapors”), incorporated in the State of Florida, on April 26, 2012. The acquisition has been treated as a recapitalization
of Freebutton, Inc. (now known as A1 Group, Inc.), with A1 Vapors, Inc. as the accounting acquirer in accordance with the Reverse
Merger rules. As a result of the consummation of the Share Exchange Agreement A-1 Vapors became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company and the electronic cigarette business of A-1 Vapors is now the primary business of the Company. A1
Group, Inc., (formerly known as Freebutton, Inc.) and through its wholly owned subsidiary A-1 Vapors Inc., is a product development
and marketing company catering to the electronic cigarette and accessory industry, with internet sales and multiple kiosk retail
locations in the Miami area. Bruce Storrs, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer, Treasurer, Secretary, Director and Andy
Diaz Chief Operating Officer, Director of the Company, and are the sole shareholders’ of A1 Vapors, Inc. As
a result of the Share Exchange Agreement, Bruce Storrs and Andy Diaz became the majority shareholders and became the principal
officers and directors of the Company. As reported in our Form 8-K file with the SEC
on May 14, 2014, on April 11, 2014 the Company entered into a Binding Letter of Intent (“LOI”) to acquire A1 Vapors,
Inc. a product development and marketing firm catering to the electronic vapor cigarette industry. Under the terms of the LOI the
Company will purchase all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of A1 pursuant to a definitive agreement to be entered into
between the parties. Consideration for the purchase will be approximately 21 million restricted shares of the Company’s common
stock. As reported in our Current Report on Form 8-k filed on May 27, 2014, on May 23, 2014 FreeButton (now known as A1 Group,
Inc.) entered into an exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with A1 Vapors. Under the terms of the Exchange
Agreement, the shareholders of A1 Vapors received 21,000,000 newly-issued shares of Free Button’s (now known as A1 Group,
Inc.) Common Stock (now known as A1 Group, Inc.) in exchange for all of A1 Vapor’s outstanding Common Stock. On August 22,
2014, the 21,000,000 shares were issued and A1Vapors, Inc. became a wholly-owned subsidiary of A1 Group Inc. (formerly FreeButton
Inc.). The foregoing description of the LOI does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
full text of the LOI, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.3 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated herein by reference.
The foregoing description of the Exchange Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference
to the full text of the LOI, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.4 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated herein
by reference. FSC Agreement On November 29, 2014 the Company entered into
an Agreement with FSC Company (“FSC”) to assist with the development of a corporate vision and to build a comprehensive
Operating Plan to guide the Company, and to assist in the designing of a strategic sales and marketing plan, with an associated
branding strategy. This agreement includes the following; Term: Six (6) months. Either party may terminate the Agreement after four (4) months with a thirty (30)
day advance written notice. Fees: Initial fee of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) at time this agreement is executed and six thousand
($6,000) per month during the final five (5) months of the engagement period. Incentives: the Company and FSC agree to establish an incentive plan. The Company has to provide FSC up to
five hundred thousand (500,000) shares of common stock in A1Group, Inc. following the initial one hundred and twenty (120) days
of the term of this Agreement , so long as items listed in the Agreement have been satisfactory delivered and all terms and conditions
of the Agreement have been met. 2 Convertible Promissory Notes Subsequent to the period on January 16, 2015
an agreement was reached whereby the Convertible Promissory Note of $307,266.26 dated March 11, 2014 and $16,828.56 dated June
20, 2014 would be converted to 1,473,161 common shares of A1 Group, Inc. without restrictive legend. Upon deliverance of the share
certificate they will be no further obligations under the convertible promissory notes. As of the filing date of the Company’s10-K
the certificate had not yet be delivered. As reported in the Company’s 8-K dated March 3, 2015. Our Website We currently have one operating website, www.a1vapors.com . We sell our electronic cigarettes and accessories through the web-site. Products The Company offer
disposable electronic cigarettes in multiple sizes, puff counts, styles, flavors and nicotine strengths; rechargeable electronic
cigarettes that use replaceable cartridges (also known as “atomizers or cartomizers”); and rechargeable vaporizers
for use with either electronic cigarette solution (“e-liquid”) or dry herbs or leaf. We have established
arrangements with certain third party manufacturers, Kanger and Aspire, to re-brand or “white label” most of the products
that we sell, which are manufactured by Kanger and Aspire, with the A1 Vapors logo. In addition, we sell major known brands such
as Cloupor. Product Descriptions · The disposable electronic cigarettes feature
a one-piece construction that houses ass the components and is utilized until the nicotine or nicotine free solution is depleted. · Rechargeable electronic cigarettes feature
a rechargeable battery and replaceable cartridge (also known as an “atomizer or cartomizer”). The atomizers or cartomizers
are changed when the solution is depleted from use. · Vaporizers feature a tank or chamber,
a heating element and a battery. The vaporizer user fills the tank with the e-liquid or the Chamber with dry herb or leaf. The
vaporizer battery can be recharged and the tank and chamber can be refilled. · The electronic cigarette solution or e-liquid,
is the chemical means through which electronic cigarettes and vaporizers, respectively, deliver nicotine, simulate the taste of
tobacco and or other flavors in addition to emulating the act of smoking by means of the electronic cigarettes “smoke like”
discharge or vapor. We offer the electronic cigarette solutions in different flavors and various strengths, in replaceable cartridges
for our rechargeable e-cigarettes and in bottles for use in our vaporizers. Competition Competition in the electronic cigarette
industry is intense. We compete with other sellers of electronic cigarettes and hookahs, big tobacco companies such as; Altria
Group, Inc., Lorillard, Inc., Reynolds America Inc.; through their electronic cigarettes business segments; the nature of our competitors
is varied as the market is highly fragmented and the barriers to entry into the business are low. Our direct competitors sell products
that are substantially similar to ours and through the same channels through which we sell our electronic cigarette products. We
compete with these direct competitors for sales through distributors, wholesalers and retailers, including but not limited to national
chain stores, tobacco shops, gas stations, travel stores, shopping mall kiosks, in addition to direct public sales through internet,
mail order and telesales. As a general matter, we have access
to, market and sell the similar electronic cigarettes as our competitors and we sell our products generally at similar prices as
our competitors; accordingly the key competitive factors for our success is the quality of service we offer our customers, the
scope and effectiveness of our marketing efforts, including media advertising campaigns and, increasingly, the ability to identify
and develop new sources of customers. 3 We believe that we will enjoy the following
competitive advantages: Marketing, Sales
and Distribution To this point our
marketing and sales efforts have been limited. As our cash-flow permits, we will increase our advertising efforts through direct
television marketing, on the Internet, trade magazine ads and point of sale materials and displays at retail locations. We will
also attempt to build brand awareness through innovative social marketing activities, price promotions, in-store and on-premises
promotions, public relations and trade show participation. We intend to expand
our physical retail locations on a geographical basis, adding more stores in areas that are proximate to our existing locations.
We believe this strategy will enable us to create a stronger presence in our core market and maximize our brand awareness in the
region. We intend to increase our online marketing budget and more proactively market our website store to drive online sales. We have not historically
focused on the wholesale market, and the sale which we have made to our retailers has been inconsistent. We intend to start focusing
on the opportunity by developing a retail package specifically for the distributor sales channel. We are in product development
with respect to this effort and in discussions with prospective channel partners with the goal of testing our products in their
stores. Customers We cater to two types of consumers,
cigarette smokers and hookah smokers from the ages of 18 and up. Legal Environment Governmental Regulations Based on the December 2010 U.S. Court of Appeals
for the D.C. Circuit’s decision in Sottera, Inc. v. Food & Drug Administration , 627 F.3d 891 (D.C. Cir. 2010),
the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) is permitted to regulate electronic cigarettes as “tobacco
products” under the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009 (the “Tobacco Control Act”). Under this Court decision, the FDA is not permitted
to regulate electronic cigarettes as “drugs” or “devices” or a “combination product” under
the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act unless they are marketed for therapeutic purposes. Because we do not market our electronic cigarettes
for therapeutic purposes, our electronic cigarettes are subject to being classified as “tobacco products” under the
Tobacco Control Act. The Tobacco Control Act grants the FDA broad authority over the manufacture, sale, marketing and packaging
of tobacco products, although the FDA is prohibited from issuing regulations banning all cigarettes or all smokeless tobacco products,
or requiring the reduction of nicotine yields of a tobacco product to zero. The Tobacco Control Act also requires
establishment, within the FDA’s new Center for Tobacco Products, of a Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee to
provide advice, information and recommendations with respect to the safety, dependence or health issues related to tobacco products. The
Tobacco Control Act imposes significant new restrictions on the advertising and promotion of tobacco products. For example, the
law requires the FDA to finalize certain portions of regulations previously adopted by the FDA in 1996 (which were struck down
by the Supreme Court in 2000 as beyond the FDA’s authority). As written, these regulations would significantly limit the
ability of manufacturers, distributors and retailers to advertise and promote tobacco products, by, for example, restricting the
use of color, graphics and sound effects in advertising, limiting the use of outdoor advertising, restricting the sale and distribution
of non-tobacco items and services, gifts, and sponsorship of events and imposing restrictions on the use for cigarette or smokeless
tobacco products of trade or brand names that are used for non-tobacco products. The law also requires the FDA to issue future
regulations regarding the promotion and marketing of tobacco products sold or distributed over the internet, by mail order or
through other non-face-to-face transactions in order to prevent the sale of tobacco products to minors. 4 It is likely that the Tobacco Control Act could
result in a decrease in tobacco product sales in the United States, including sales of our electronic cigarettes. While the FDA has not yet mandated electronic
cigarettes should be regulated as tobacco products, during 2012, the FDA indicated that it intends to regulate electronic cigarettes
under the Tobacco Control Act through the issuance of deeming regulations that would include electronic cigarettes under the definition
of a “tobacco product” under the Tobacco Control Act subject to the FDA’s jurisdiction. The FDA initially announced
that it would issue proposed deeming regulations by April 2013 and then extended the deadline to October 31, 2013. As of the
date of this report, the FDA had not taken such action. The application of the Tobacco Control Act
to electronic cigarettes could impose, among other things, restrictions on the content of nicotine in electronic cigarettes, the
advertising, marketing and sale of electronic cigarettes, the use of certain flavorings and the introduction of new products. We
cannot predict the scope of such regulations or the impact they may have on our company specifically or the electronic cigarette
industry generally, though if enacted, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition. In this regard, total compliance and related
costs are not possible to predict and depend substantially on the future requirements imposed by the FDA under the Tobacco Control
Act. Costs, however, could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition. In addition, failure to comply with the Tobacco Control Act and with FDA regulatory requirements could result in significant
financial penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and
ability to market and sell our products. At present, we are not able to predict whether the Tobacco Control Act will impact us
to a greater degree than competitors in the industry, thus affecting our competitive position. State and local governments currently legislate
and regulate tobacco products, including what is considered a tobacco product, how tobacco taxes are calculated and collected,
to whom and by whom tobacco products can be sold and where tobacco products may or may not be smoked. Certain states and cities
have enacted laws which preclude the use of electronic cigarettes where traditional tobacco burning cigarettes cannot be used and
others have proposed legislation that would categorize electronic cigarettes as tobacco products, equivalent to their tobacco burning
counterparts. If the use of electronic cigarettes is banned anywhere the use of traditional tobacco burning cigarettes is banned,
electronic cigarettes may lose their appeal as an alternative to cigarettes; which may have the effect of reducing the demand for
our products and as a result have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. At present, neither the Prevent All Cigarette
Trafficking Act (which prohibits the use of the U.S. Postal Service to mail most tobacco products and which amends the Jenkins
Act, which would require individuals and businesses that make interstate sales of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco to comply with
state tax laws) nor the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (which governs how cigarettes can be advertised and marketed)
apply to electronic cigarettes. The application of either or both of these federal laws to electronic cigarettes would have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The Tobacco industry expects significant regulatory
developments to take place over the next few years, driven principally by the World Health Organization’s Framework Convention
on Tobacco Control (“FCTC”). The FCTC is the first international public health treaty on tobacco, and its objective
is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation.
Regulatory initiatives that have been proposed, introduced or enacted include: · The levying of substantial and increasing tax and duty charges; · Restrictions or bans on advertising, marketing and sponsorship; · The display of larger health warnings, graphic health warnings and other labeling requirements; · Restrictions on a packaging design, including the use of colors and generic packaging; · Restrictions on bans on the display of tobacco product packaging at the point of sale, and restrictions or bans on cigarette vending machines; 5 · Restrictions regarding testing, disclosure and performance standards for tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide and other smoke constituent levels; · Requirements regarding testing, disclosure and use of tobacco product ingredients; · Increased restrictions on smoking in public and work places and, in some instances in private places and outdoors · Elimination of duty free allowances for travelers; and · Encouraging litigation against tobacco companies. If electronic cigarettes are subject
to one or more significant regulatory initiates enacted under the FCTC, our business, results of operations and financial condition
could be materially and adversely affected. Available Information Reports we file pursuant to the Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), including annual, quarterly and current reports and other information with

FINANCIAL DATA Not applicable to a “smaller reporting
company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with
a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and certain other
factors that may affect our future results. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited
consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data.” In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements
that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. See “Forward-Looking Statements.” Our results and the timing of
selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors. Business Overview We are an electronic cigarette company
with Internet sales and kiosk locations in the greater Miami area through our fully owned subsidiary A1 Vapors, Inc. A1 Vapors
is a product development and marketing company catering to the electronic vapor cigarette and accessories industry. A1 Vapors offers
a variety of options to choose from to appeal to all smokers including a diverse selection of devices and flavors. “Electronic cigarettes” or
“e-cigarettes” and “vaporizers” are battery-powered products that enable users to inhale nicotine vapor
without smoke, tar, ash, or carbon monoxide. Electronic cigarettes look like traditional cigarettes and, regardless of their construction
are comprised of three functional components: · A mouthpiece, which is a small plastic
cartridge that contains a liquid nicotine solution; · The heating element that vaporizes the
liquid nicotine so that it can be inhaled; and · The electronics, which include: a lithium-ion
battery, an airflow sensor, a microchip controller and an LED which illuminates to indicate use. 8 When a user draws air through the electronic
cigarette and or vaporizer, the air flow is detected by a sensor, which activates a heating element that vaporizes the solution
stored in the mouthpiece/cartridge, the solution is then vaporized and it is this vapor that is inhaled by the user. The cartridge
contains either a nicotine solution or a nicotine free solution, either which may be flavored. Plan of Operations Our Plan is to become a leading retailer of electronic cigarette
and vapor related products in the North American market. We intend to accomplish that objective through competing on price and
quality, expanding our presence at physical locations, expanding distribution points and expanding our online presence. The brands that we select to sell in addition to the A-1 Vapors,
white-label brand, are selected on their general popularity with our target consumer base. We believe that this strategy will enable
us to continue to offer “best-in-class” products which have the potential to increase our sales the most, while avoiding
risk of product development and manufacturing. Our ability to negotiate reasonable pricing with these manufactures is also a contributing
factor to selection. We will continue to seek out and identify new products to introduce
to our consumer base which we believe will increase our revenue per person and generate greater repeat business such as starter
kits, a variety of batteries and new flavors to our line of e-liquid. Going Concern Our auditor has indicated in their reports
on our financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2014, that conditions exist that raise substantial doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern due to our recurring losses from operations, deficit in equity, and the need to raise
additional capital to fund operations. A “going concern” opinion could impair our ability to finance our operations
through the sale of debt or equity securities. Results of Operations Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2014 compared to Fiscal Year Ended
December 31, 2013 Revenue. We generated
$273,878 of revenue and had Cost of Goods of $92,551 with net revenues of $181,327 during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014
and we generated $207,836 of revenue and had Cost of Goods of $99,953 with net revenues of $107,883 during the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2013. Operating Expenses. Total
expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 were $268,364 resulting in an operating loss for the fiscal year of $87,037
as compared to total expenses of $81,056 resulting in an operating profit of $26,827 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013.
The operating loss for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 is a result of office and general expenses in the amount of $268,364,
made up of management fee of $34,500, rent expense of $117,656, commissions of $30,643, marketing expenses of $19,031 and professional
fees in the amount of $11,375 as compared to office and general expenses in the amount of $81,056, made up of management fee of
$0, rent expense of $46,527, commissions of $7,598, marketing expenses of $393 and professional fees in the amount of $225 for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in office and general expenses from fiscal
year 2013 to fiscal year 2014 was due to expenses related to reverse takeover of A-1 Vapors Inc., of Freebutton, Inc. (now known
as A1Group, Inc.) and cost associated with this merger. The increase in management fees from fiscal year 2013 to fiscal year 2014
described above was due to the increased management time needed to manage the acquisition of the Assets of the new entity. In
addition, costs increased due to the transition from A-1 Group/Vapors from a private corporation into a public entity. Interest
expense for the year ended December 31, 2014, was $20,684 compared to interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2013, in
the amount of $0. Interest expense principally consists of interest on the convertible promissory notes issued by the Company
as previously discussed in our Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2014. Gain on debt settlement
of $10,251 for the year ended December 31, 2014 was the result of the merger of the A-1 Vapors Inc. and Freebutton, Inc. (now
known as A1 Group, Inc.), there was $0 Gain/loss on debt settlement for the year ending December 31, 2013. 9 Capital Resources
and Liquidity As of December 31, 2014, we had $24,031
of cash compared to $3,856 of cash for the year ended December 31, 2013. We anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents
and cash generated from financing activities will be insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months.
To date the Company has incurred operating losses since inception of $528,868. As at December 31, 2014, the Company has a working
capital deficit of $351,774. The Company requires additional funding
to meet its ongoing obligations and to fund anticipated operating losses. Our auditor has expressed substantial doubt about our
ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising capital
to fund its initial business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. These financial statements do not include any
adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities
that might result from this uncertainty. We expect to incur marketing and professional
and administrative expenses as well expenses associated with maintaining our filings with the Commission. We will require additional
funds during this time and will seek to raise the necessary additional capital. If we are unable to obtain additional financing,
we may be required to reduce the scope of our business development activities, which could harm our business plans, financial condition
and operating results. Additional funding may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. The Company intends to continue to
fund its business by way of equity or debt financing and advances from related parties. In the event we seek to raise additional
capital through the issuance of debt or its equivalents, this will result in increased interest expense. If we raise additional
capital through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our company held by existing
shareholders will be reduced and those shareholders may experience significant dilution. In addition, new securities may contain
certain rights, preferences or privileges that are senior to those of our common stock. We cannot assure you that we will be able
to raise the working capital as needed in the future on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Any inability to raise capital as needed
would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we cannot raise additional funds,
we will have to cease business operations. As a result, investors in the Company’s common stock would lose all of their investment. Off Balance Sheet
Arrangements There are no off-balance sheet arrangements
currently contemplated by management or in place that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the business,
financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, result of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures
and/or capital resources. Recent Accounting
Pronouncements The Company has implemented all new
accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any
other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results
of operations. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Not applicable to a “smaller reporting
company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA The full text of the Company's audited consolidated
financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, begins on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 10 CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS
WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 8A. CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of
Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, including our chief
executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of December 31, 2014. Our management does not expect that our disclosure
controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures,
management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance
of achieving the desired control objectives. Based on the evaluation as of December
31, 2014, for the reasons set forth below, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports
that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management's
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Our internal control system was designed to,
in general, provide reasonable assurance to our management and the Board regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, but because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Our chief executive officer and chief
financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, and based
on that evaluation they concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective. The framework used by management in
making that assessment was the criteria set forth in the document entitled “Internal Control – Integrated Framework”
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that re-evaluation due to material weakness
identified below, our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2014 to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange
Act reports was (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a timely manner, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure, because of material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency,
or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that
a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control our financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, the Company determined
that the following items constituted a material weakness: · The Company does not have an independent audit committee in place, which would provide oversight
of the Company’s officers, operations and financial reporting function; · The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures do not provide adequate segregation of duties;
and · The Company does not have effective controls over period-end financial disclosure and reporting
processes. 11 The management believes that the material
weaknesses set forth in the last two items listed above did not have an effect on our financial results. However, management believes
that the lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, results in
ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures which could result in a
material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods. Management believes that the appointment
of one or more outside directors, who shall be appointed to a fully-functioning audit committee, will remedy the lack of a functioning
audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board. We will continue to monitor and evaluate
the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis
and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds
allow. Changes in
Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes that have affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or
15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2014. ITEM 8B. OTHER

any equity awards, including, options, restricted stock, performance awards or other equity incentives during the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2014 and 2013 for either A1 Group, Inc., or A-1 Vapors, Inc. Employment Agreements On August 15, 2014 A1 Group, Inc., (the “Company”)
signed an initial two (2) year Employment Agreement with it Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Bruce Storrs. The Company has agreed to
a salary of $3,500 per month starting September 1, 2014 and a lump sum signing bonus of $10,000 due on August 29, 2014. The Storrs
Agreement also calls for participation in an additional bonus plan to be determined by the Company’s board of directors. On August 15, 2014 A1 Group, Inc., (the “Company”)
signed an initial two (2) year Employment Agreement with it Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Andy Diaz. The Company has agreed to a
salary of $3,500 per month starting September 1, 2014. During the period ending December 31, 2014,
the Company paid a total of $34,500 in management fees. The foregoing descriptions of the terms of
Storrs Agreement and Diaz Agreement do not purport to be complete are qualified in their entirety by reference to the provisions
of such agreements as reported in our From 8-K filed with the SEC on August 22, 2014. 14 Compensation
of Directors During the fiscal years ended December
31, 2014 and 2013, the Company directors did not receive any compensation solely for services as a director. Our directors Bruce Storrs, Andy Diaz,
Michele Evangelista and Moses Lopez will not receive any compensation solely for services as a director. It is our current policy
that our directors are reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in attending each board of directors meeting or
meeting of a committee of the board of directors. Board Committees We have not formed an Audit Committee,
Compensation Committee or Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee as of the filing of this Annual Report. Our Board of Directors
performs the principal functions of an Audit Committee. We currently do not have an audit committee financial expert on our Board
of Directors. We believe that an audit committee financial expert is not required because the cost of hiring an audit committee
financial expert to act as one of our directors and to be a member of an Audit Committee outweighs the benefits of having an audit
committee financial expert at this time. Section 16(a)
Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires
our directors, officers and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities, to file
reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC and are required to furnish us with copies of these reports. Based solely
on our review of the reports filed with the SEC, we believe that all persons subject to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act timely
filed all required reports in 2014. Compensation
Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation During fiscal years 2014 and 2013, we
did not have a standing compensation committee. Our Board was responsible for the functions that would otherwise be handled by
the compensation committee. Our four directors conducted deliberations concerning executive officer compensation, including directors
who were also executive officers. ITEM 11. SECURITY

E R T I F I E D P U B L I C A C C O U N T A N T S Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
of A1 Group, Inc. We have audited the accompanying
balance sheets of A1 Group, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related statements of operations,
changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2014. Multimedia
Platforms, Inc.’s management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Multimedia Platforms, Inc. as
of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period
ended December 31, 2014 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying
financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note A to
the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a significant amount of accumulated
deficit that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters
are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this
uncertainty. Bedinger

(AUDITED) DECEMBER 31, 2014 NOTE
1 – NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION The Company was incorporated on November 27,
2006 under the laws of the State of Nevada and extra-provincially registered under the laws of the Province of Ontario on February
2, 2007. On September 28, 2012, the Company with a majority of the shareholders and directors changed its name from Secured Window
Blinds, Inc. to Freebutton, Inc. On June 23, 2014 a majority of the shareholders and directors and on November 23, 2014 changed
its name from Freebutton, Inc. to A1 Group, Inc. A1 Group, Inc. is now a product development
and marketing company catering to the electronic vapour cigarette and accessories industry. On August 14, 2014, the Company entered into
a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) which resulted in a Reverse Takeover with selling stockholders
named in the prospectus, pursuant to which the Company offered and sold an aggregate of 21,000,000 shares of common stock to all
the stockholders of A-1 Vapors,, Inc., a Florida corporation (“A-1 Vapors”), incorporated in the State of Florida,
on April 26, 2012. The acquisition has been treated as a recapitalization of Freebutton, Inc. with A-1 Vapors, Inc. as the accounting
acquirer in accordance with the Reverse Merger rules. As a result of the consummation of the Share Exchange Agreement A-1 Vapors
became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the electronic cigarette business of A-1 Vapors is now the primary business
of the Company. Going concern To date the Company has generated revenues
from its business operations and has incurred operating losses since inception of $528,868. As at December 31, 2014, the Company
has a working capital deficit of $351,774. The Company requires additional funding to meet its ongoing obligations and to fund
anticipated operating losses. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on increasing sales and raising
capital to fund its initial business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. Accordingly, these factors raise substantial
doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company intends to continue to fund its business by
way of private placements and advances from related parties as may be required. These financial statements do not include any adjustments
relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that
might result from this uncertainty. NOTE 2
– SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation Segmented Reporting Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FSAB”)
Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) 280, “Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information”,
changed the way public companies report information about segments of their business in their quarterly reports issued to shareholders.
It also requires entity-wide disclosures about the products and services the entity provides, the material countries in which it
holds assets and reports revenues and its major customers. Comprehensive Loss FASB Statement Number 130, “Reporting
Comprehensive Income,” establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and its components in the
financial statements. As at December 31, 2014, the Company has no items that represent a comprehensive loss and, therefore, has
not included a schedule of comprehensive loss in the financial statements. Use of Estimates and Assumptions Preparation of the financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. Financial Instruments All significant financial assets, financial
liabilities and equity instruments of the Company are either recognized or disclosed in the financial statements together with
other information relevant for making a reasonable assessment of future cash flows, interest rate risk and credit risk. Where practical
the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been determined and disclosed; otherwise only available information
pertinent to fair value has been disclosed. F- 8 A1 GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(AUDITED) DECEMBER 31, 2014 NOTE 2
– SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) Revenue Recognition It is our policy that revenues are recognized
in accordance with ASC 605-10. Under ASC 605-10, product revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue is recognized
at the point of sale for in person purchases and upon shipping for Internet sales. Loss per Common Share Basic earnings (loss) per share includes no
dilution and is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for the period. Dilutive earnings (loss) per share reflect the potential dilution of securities that could share in
the earnings of the Company. Because the Company does not have any potential dilutive securities, the accompanying presentation
is only on the basic loss per share. Income Taxes The Company follows the liability method
of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
and their respective tax balances and tax loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted
or substantially enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of
management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the date
of enactment or substantive enactment. Principles of consolidation The Company consolidates its 100% owned subsidiary
pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) No. 810, “Consolidation”. All intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated. Inventory We value our inventories at the lower of cost,
determined on a first-in, first-out method, or market value. Our inventory consists solely of finished goods. We review inventories
on hand at least quarterly and record provisions for estimated excess, slow moving and obsolete inventory, as well as inventory
with a carrying value in excess of net realizable value. The regular and systematic inventory valuation reviews include a current
assessment of future product demand, historical experience and obsolete finished product. Stock-based Compensation The Company follows FASB ASC 718-10, "Stock
Compensation", which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods
or services, with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions.
ASC 718-10 is a revision to SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," and supersedes Accounting Principles
Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and its related implementation guidance.
ASC 718-10 requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based
on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). Incremental compensation costs arising from subsequent modifications
of awards after the grant date must be recognized. No stock-based compensation has been issued as of December 31, 2014. Advertising Costs The Company accounts for advertising costs
in accordance with provisions in ASC 720-35-25 which states that advertising costs can be expensed as incurred or the first time
the advertising takes place. Recent Accounting Pronouncements The Company has implemented all new accounting
pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new
accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. F- 9 A1 GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Promissory Note for $10,000, with an interest rate of 8% with a maturity date of October 23, 2014. The issuer of the Convertible
Promissory Note has the option to convert all or portion of the Promissory Note into common shares of the Company. The Conversion
price share would be $0.10, unless the Company has, between the issue date of the Promissory Note and its Maturity date, sold its
capital stock in financing in which the Company received gross proceeds of an excess of $90,000 at a differing price. On December
23, 2014 the Convertible Promissory Note of $10,000 plus accrued interest of $800 were converted to 108,000 restricted common shares
of the Company at $0.10 per share. On December 23, 2013 the Company signed a Convertible
Promissory Note for $20,000, with an interest rate of 8% with a maturity date of December 23, 2014. The issuer of the Convertible
Promissory Note has the option to convert all or portion of the Promissory Note into common shares of the Company. The Conversion
price share would be $0.10, unless the Company has, between the issue date of the Promissory Note and its Maturity date, sold its
capital stock in financing in which the Company received gross proceeds of an excess of $180,000 at a differing price. On December
23, 2014 the Convertible Promissory Note of $20,000 plus accrued interest of $1,600 were converted to 216,000 restricted common
shares of the Company at $0.10 per share. On March 11, 2014 the Company signed a
consolidated and extension of the Company’s Promissory Notes. The New total amount of the combined Promissory Note is
$307,266.26 with an interest rate of 8% and maturity date of August 28, 2014. The Conversion price share would be $0.10,
unless the Company has, between the issue date of the Promissory Note and its Maturity date, sold its capital stock in
financing in which the Company received gross proceeds of an excess of $1,000,000 at a differing price. In the event the
Company does not pay the outstanding balance by August 28, 2014, the interest rate of the Promissory Note increases to 12%
per annum. The promissory note is in default and the 12% interest rate is in effect. (Refer to Note 9 – Subsequent
Events). On June 20, 2014 the Company signed a Convertible
Promissory Note for $16,828.56, with an interest rate of 8% with a maturity date of December 20, 2014. The issuer of the Convertible

capital stock in financing in which the Company received gross proceeds of an excess of $152,000 at a differing price. (Refer to
Note 9 – Subsequent Events). The conversion of the Promissory Note(s) is
contingent upon an “Event Default” and the Promissory Note is not currently convertible. If the Promissory Note does
become convertible the non-cash expense to the Company is dependent on the trading value of the Company’s stock on the day
of conversion and the $0.10 conversion price. The estimated non-cash expense if the Promissory notes had been converted as of December
31, 2014 would have been $678,735. Subsequent to the period on January 16, 2015
an agreement was reached whereby the Convertible Promissory Note of $307,266.26 dated March 11, 2014 and $16,828.56 dated June
20, 2014 would be converted to 1,473,161 common shares of A1 Group, Inc. without restrictive legend. Upon deliverance of the share
certificate they will be no further obligations under the convertible promissory notes. As of the filing date of the Company’s10-K
the certificate had not yet be delivered. F- 11 A1 GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Common Stock in exchange for all of A1 Vapor’s outstanding Common Stock. A1 Vapors, Inc. has become a wholly-owned subsidiary

Vapors as the accounting acquirer in accordance with the Reverse Merger rules. As a result of the proposed consummation of the
Share Exchange Agreement A1 Vapors, Inc. will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the electronic vapour cigarette
industry will become the primary business of the company. NOTE 8 –
INCOME TAXES For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013,
the Company incurred net operating losses and, accordingly, no provision for income taxes has been recorded. In addition, no benefit
for income taxes has been recorded due to the uncertainty of the realization of any tax assets. At December 31, 2014 and 2013,
the Company had approximately $32,925 and $nil of federal and state net operating losses. The net operating loss carry forwards,
if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2026. The provision for income taxes consisted of the following components for the years
ended December 31: Components of net deferred tax assets, including
a valuation allowance, are as follows at December 31: December 31 2014 2013 Deferred tax assets: Net operating loss carry forwards $ 32,925 $ nil Valuation allowance (32,925 ) (nil) Total deferred tax assets $ – $ – The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets
as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $32,925 and $nil respectively. In assessing the recovery of the deferred tax assets, management
considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in the periods in which those temporary
differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of future deferred tax liabilities, projected future
taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. As a result, management determined it was more likely than
not the deferred tax assets would not be realized as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and recorded a full valuation allowance. Reconciliation between the statutory rate and
the effective tax rate is as follows at December 31: 2014 & 2013 Federal statutory tax rate (35.0) % Permanent difference and other 35.0 % F- 12 A1 GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 12 Months Ended Dec. 31, 2014 Accounting Policies [Abstract] SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation Segmented
Reporting Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FSAB) Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 280, Disclosure about Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information, changed the way public companies report information about segments of their business
in their quarterly reports issued to shareholders. It also requires entity-wide disclosures about the products and services the
entity provides, the material countries in which it holds assets and reports revenues and its major customers. Comprehensive
Loss FASB Statement
Number 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive
loss and its components in the financial statements. As at December 31, 2014, the Company has no items that represent a comprehensive
loss and, therefore, has not included a schedule of comprehensive loss in the financial statements. Use of Estimates
and Assumptions Preparation of
the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Accordingly, actual
results could differ from those estimates. Financial
Instruments All significant
financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments of the Company are either recognized or disclosed in the financial
statements together with other information relevant for making a reasonable assessment of future cash flows, interest rate risk
and credit risk. Where practical the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been determined and disclosed;
otherwise only available information pertinent to fair value has been disclosed. Revenue Recognition It is our policy
that revenues are recognized in accordance with ASC 605-10. Under ASC 605-10, product revenues are recognized when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed and determinable and collectability
is reasonably assured. Revenue is recognized at the point of sale for in person purchases and upon shipping for Internet sales. Loss per Common
Share Basic earnings
(loss) per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Dilutive earnings (loss) per share reflect the potential dilution
of securities that could share in the earnings of the Company. Because the Company does not have any potential dilutive securities,
the accompanying presentation is only on the basic loss per share. Income Taxes The Company follows
the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax balances and tax loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted or substantially enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion
of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the date of
enactment or substantive enactment. Principles
of consolidation The Company
consolidates its 100% owned subsidiary pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) No. 810,
Consolidation. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Inventory We value our
inventories at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out method, or market value. Our inventory consists solely of
finished goods. We review inventories on hand at least quarterly and record provisions for estimated excess, slow moving and obsolete
inventory, as well as inventory with a carrying value in excess of net realizable value. The regular and systematic inventory
valuation reviews include a current assessment of future product demand, historical experience and obsolete finished product. Stock-based
Compensation The Company follows
FASB ASC 718-10, "Stock Compensation", which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges
its equity instruments for goods or services, with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services
in share-based payment transactions. ASC 718-10 is a revision to SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,"
and supersedes Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,"
and its related implementation guidance. ASC 718-10 requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange
for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). Incremental compensation
costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must be recognized. No stock-based compensation has
been issued as of December 31, 2014. Advertising
Costs The Company accounts
for advertising costs in accordance with provisions in ASC 720-35-25 which states that advertising costs can be expensed as incurred
or the first time the advertising takes place. Recent Accounting
Pronouncements The Company has
implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe
that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial

Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation 12 Months Ended Dec. 31, 2014 Organization, Consolidation and Presentation of Financial Statements [Abstract] NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION The Company was
incorporated on November 27, 2006 under the laws of the State of Nevada and extra-provincially registered under the laws of the
Province of Ontario on February 2, 2007. On September 28, 2012, the Company with a majority of the shareholders and directors
changed its name from Secured Window Blinds, Inc. to Freebutton, Inc. On June 23, 2014 a majority of the shareholders and directors
and on November 23, 2014 changed its name from Freebutton, Inc. to A1 Group, Inc. A1 Group, Inc.
is now a product development and marketing company catering to the electronic vapour cigarette and accessories industry. On August 14,
2014, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the Share Exchange Agreement) which resulted in a Reverse
Takeover with selling stockholders named in the prospectus, pursuant to which the Company offered and sold an aggregate of 21,000,000
shares of common stock to all the stockholders of A-1 Vapors,, Inc., a Florida corporation (A-1 Vapors), incorporated
in the State of Florida, on April 26, 2012. The acquisition has been treated as a recapitalization of Freebutton, Inc. with A-1
Vapors, Inc. as the accounting acquirer in accordance with the Reverse Merger rules. As a result of the consummation of the Share
Exchange Agreement A-1 Vapors became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the electronic cigarette business of A-1 Vapors
is now the primary business of the Company. Going concern To date the Company
has generated revenues from its business operations and has incurred operating losses since inception of $528,868. As at December
31, 2014, the Company has a working capital deficit of $351,774. The Company requires additional funding to meet its ongoing obligations
and to fund anticipated operating losses. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on increasing
sales and raising capital to fund its initial business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. Accordingly, these
factors raise substantial doubt as to the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The Company intends to continue
to fund its business by way of private placements and advances from related parties as may be required. These financial statements
do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification
of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.

Convertible Promissory Note 12 Months Ended Dec. 31, 2014 Debt Disclosure [Abstract] CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTE On October 23,
2013 the Company signed a Convertible Promissory Note for $10,000, with an interest rate of 8% with a maturity date of October
23, 2014. The issuer of the Convertible Promissory Note has the option to convert all or portion of the Promissory Note into common
shares of the Company. The Conversion price share would be $0.10, unless the Company has, between the issue date of the Promissory
Note and its Maturity date, sold its capital stock in financing in which the Company received gross proceeds of an excess of $90,000
at a differing price. On December 23, 2014 the Convertible Promissory Note of $10,000 plus accrued interest of $800 were converted
to 108,000 restricted common shares of the Company at $0.10 per share. On December 23,
2013 the Company signed a Convertible Promissory Note for $20,000, with an interest rate of 8% with a maturity date of December
23, 2014. The issuer of the Convertible Promissory Note has the option to convert all or portion of the Promissory Note into common
shares of the Company. The Conversion price share would be $0.10, unless the Company has, between the issue date of the Promissory
Note and its Maturity date, sold its capital stock in financing in which the Company received gross proceeds of an excess of $180,000
at a differing price. On December 23, 2014 the Convertible Promissory Note of $20,000 plus accrued interest of $1,600 were converted
to 216,000 restricted common shares of the Company at $0.10 per share. On March
11, 2014 the Company signed a consolidated and extension of the Companys Promissory Notes. The New total amount of the
combined Promissory Note is $307,266.26 with an interest rate of 8% and maturity date of August 28, 2014. The Conversion
price share would be $0.10, unless the Company has, between the issue date of the Promissory Note and its Maturity date, sold
its capital stock in financing in which the Company received gross proceeds of an excess of $1,000,000 at a differing price.
In the event the Company does not pay the outstanding balance by August 28, 2014, the interest rate of the Promissory Note
increases to 12% per annum. The promissory note is in default and the 12% interest rate is in effect. (Refer to Note 9 
Subsequent Events). On June 20, 2014
the Company signed a Convertible Promissory Note for $16,828.56, with an interest rate of 8% with a maturity date of December
20, 2014. The issuer of the Convertible Promissory Note has the option to convert all or portion of the Promissory Note into common
shares of the Company. The Conversion price share would be $0.10, unless the Company has, between the issue date of the Promissory
Note and its Maturity date, sold its capital stock in financing in which the Company received gross proceeds of an excess of $152,000
at a differing price. (Refer to Note 9  Subsequent Events). The conversion
of the Promissory Note(s) is contingent upon an Event Default and the Promissory Note is not currently convertible.
If the Promissory Note does become convertible the non-cash expense to the Company is dependent on the trading value of the Companys
stock on the day of conversion and the $0.10 conversion price. The estimated non-cash expense if the Promissory notes had been
converted as of December 31, 2014 would have been $678,735. Subsequent to
the period on January 16, 2015 an agreement was reached whereby the Convertible Promissory Note of $307,266.26 dated March 11,
2014 and $16,828.56 dated June 20, 2014 would be converted to 1,473,161 common shares of A1 Group, Inc. without restrictive legend.
Upon deliverance of the share certificate they will be no further obligations under the convertible promissory notes. As of the
filing date of the Companys10-K the certificate had not yet be delivered.

Income Taxes 12 Months Ended Dec. 31, 2014 Income Tax Disclosure [Abstract] INCOME TAXES For the years
ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company incurred net operating losses and, accordingly, no provision for income taxes has
been recorded. In addition, no benefit for income taxes has been recorded due to the uncertainty of the realization of any tax
assets. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company had approximately $32,925 and $nil of federal and state net operating losses.
The net operating loss carry forwards, if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2026. The provision for income taxes consisted
of the following components for the years ended December 31: Components of
net deferred tax assets, including a valuation allowance, are as follows at December 31: December 31 2014 2013 Deferred tax assets: Net operating loss carry forwards $ 32,925 $ nil Valuation allowance (32,925 ) (nil) Total deferred tax assets $  $  The valuation
allowance for deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $32,925 and $nil respectively. In assessing the recovery
of the deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax
assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable
income in the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of
future deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. As a
result, management determined it was more likely than not the deferred tax assets would not be realized as of December 31, 2014
and 2013, and recorded a full valuation allowance. Reconciliation
between the statutory rate and the effective tax rate is as follows at December 31: 2014 & 2013 Federal statutory tax rate (35.0) % Permanent difference and other 35.0 % X - Details Name: us-gaap_IncomeTaxDisclosureAbstract Namespace Prefix: us-gaap_ Data Type: xbrli:stringItemType Balance Type: na Period Type: duration X - Definition The entire disclosure for income taxes.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Policy) 12 Months Ended Dec. 31, 2014 Accounting Policies [Abstract] Segmented Reporting Segmented
Reporting Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FSAB) Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 280, Disclosure about Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information, changed the way public companies report information about segments of their business
in their quarterly reports issued to shareholders. It also requires entity-wide disclosures about the products and services the
entity provides, the material countries in which it holds assets and reports revenues and its major customers. Comprehensive Loss Comprehensive
Loss FASB Statement
Number 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive
loss and its components in the financial statements. As at December 31, 2014, the Company has no items that represent a comprehensive
loss and, therefore, has not included a schedule of comprehensive loss in the financial statements. Use of Estimates and Assumptions Use of Estimates
and Assumptions Preparation of
the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Accordingly, actual
results could differ from those estimates. Financial Instruments Financial
Instruments All significant
financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments of the Company are either recognized or disclosed in the financial
statements together with other information relevant for making a reasonable assessment of future cash flows, interest rate risk
and credit risk. Where practical the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been determined and disclosed;
otherwise only available information pertinent to fair value has been disclosed. Revenue Recognition Revenue Recognition It is our policy
that revenues are recognized in accordance with ASC 605-10. Under ASC 605-10, product revenues are recognized when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed and determinable and collectability
is reasonably assured. Revenue is recognized at the point of sale for in person purchases and upon shipping for Internet sales. Loss per Common Share Loss per Common
Share Basic earnings
(loss) per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Dilutive earnings (loss) per share reflect the potential dilution
of securities that could share in the earnings of the Company. Because the Company does not have any potential dilutive securities,
the accompanying presentation is only on the basic loss per share. Income Taxes Income Taxes The Company follows
the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax balances and tax loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted or substantially enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management,
it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the date of enactment or substantive
enactment. Principles of consolidation Principles
of consolidation The Company consolidates
its 100% owned subsidiary pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) No. 810, Consolidation. All
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Inventory Inventory We value our
inventories at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out method, or market value. Our inventory consists solely of
finished goods. We review inventories on hand at least quarterly and record provisions for estimated excess, slow moving and obsolete
inventory, as well as inventory with a carrying value in excess of net realizable value. The regular and systematic inventory
valuation reviews include a current assessment of future product demand, historical experience and obsolete finished product. Stock-based Compensation Stock-based
Compensation The Company follows
FASB ASC 718-10, "Stock Compensation", which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges
its equity instruments for goods or services, with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services
in share-based payment transactions. ASC 718-10 is a revision to SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,"
and supersedes Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,"
and its related implementation guidance. ASC 718-10 requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange
for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). Incremental compensation
costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must be recognized. No stock-based compensation has
been issued as of December 31, 2014. Advertising Costs Advertising
Costs The Company accounts
for advertising costs in accordance with provisions in ASC 720-35-25 which states that advertising costs can be expensed as incurred
or the first time the advertising takes place. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recent Accounting
Pronouncements The Company has
implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe
that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial
position or results of operations.
