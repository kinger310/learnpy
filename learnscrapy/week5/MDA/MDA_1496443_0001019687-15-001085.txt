I ITEM 1. BUSINESS. Overview We were originally incorporated in Nevada
as G.K.W., Inc. on August 24, 1995. We changed our name to Antek International, Inc. on July 1, 1996. Our common stock was approved
for trading on the OTC Bulletin Board in 1998. We changed our name to Tika Corporation on October 12, 2005. We acquired 3PEA Technologies,
Inc., a payment solutions company, in March 2006, which resulted in 3PEA Technologies, Inc. becoming our wholly owned subsidiary.
We changed our name to Paypad Inc. on March 13, 2006. On October 19, 2006 we changed our name to 3PEA International, Inc. In 2007
we acquired control of Wow Technologies, Inc., a payment solutions company with a proprietary card processing platform, in a share
exchange agreement whereby Wow Technologies, Inc. became our majority-owned subsidiary. The business of 3PEA Technologies, Inc.,
both before and after we after we acquired it, was the development of a secure payment gateway and hardware device which utilized
encryption technology and secure key exchange to facilitate PIN debit transactions over the internet. We developed proprietary
stored value systems, secure key loading systems, and acted as an encryption service organization injecting keys into its proprietary
payment terminal called the PayPad®. Users could connect the device to their computers and utilize it to make purchases over
the internet without having to provide their credit card and other personal information to the seller. Due to the lack of market
acceptance of this concept, we ultimately determined to shelve the product and reevaluate the technology and markets for potential
use in the future. 3PEA Technologies, Inc. continues to focus on the evaluation of payment terminal software and hardware technology.
We then adapted the payment platform that we developed to support prepaid debit cards, which is our current business. Business of Issuer 3PEA International, Inc. is a vertically integrated
provider of innovative prepaid card programs and processing services for corporate, consumer and government applications. Our payment
solutions are utilized by our corporate customers as a means to increase customer loyalty, reduce administration costs and streamline
operations. Public sector organizations can utilize the solutions to disburse public benefits or for internal payments. We market
our prepaid debit card solutions under our PaySign ® brand. As we are a payment processor and debit card program
manager, we derive our revenue from all stages of the debit card lifecycle. We provide a card processing platform consisting of
proprietary systems and innovative software applications based on the unique needs of our programs. We have extended our processing
business capabilities through our proprietary PaySign platform. We design and process prepaid programs that run on the platform
through which our customers can define the services they wish to offer cardholders. Through the PaySign platform, we provide a
variety of services including transaction processing, cardholder enrollment, value loading, cardholder account management, reporting,
and customer service. 3 The PaySign platform was built on modern cross-platform
architecture and designed to be highly flexible, scalable and customizable. The platform has allowed 3PEA to significantly expand
its operational capabilities by facilitating our entry into new markets within the payments space through its flexibility and ease
of customization. The PaySign platform delivers cost benefits and revenue building opportunities to our partners. We have developed prepaid card programs for
corporate and incentive rewards including, but not limited to healthcare reimbursement payments, pharmaceutical co-pay assistance,
donor payments for source plasma and automobile dealership incentives. We are expanding our product offering to include additional
corporate incentive products, payroll cards, general purpose re-loadable cards, travel cards, and expense reimbursement cards.
Our cards are offered to end users through our relationships with bank issuers. We manage all aspects of the debit card lifecycle,
from managing the card design and approval processes with partners and associations, to production, packaging, distribution, and
personalization. We also oversee inventory and security controls, renewals, lost and stolen card management and replacement. We
deploy a fully staffed, in-house customer service department which utilizes bi-lingual customer service agents, Interactive Voice
Response (IVR), and two way SMS messaging. In 2013, we began business development
activities related to opportunities in the European Union, including the opening of a satellite office within the EU. We have identified
large scale opportunities within the prepaid debit card market and are aggressively pursuing these opportunities. To date, we have issued millions of
prepaid debit cards under programs implemented for several Fortune 100 and 500 companies, including many of the top pharmaceutical
manufacturers, universities and social media companies in the world Depending on the program selected by
the client, we generate the following types of revenues: setup charges; customized software development fees; data processing and
report generation fees; transaction fees from each transaction by a consumer; interchange fees; fees from sourcing the debit cards
used for the program; and administrative fees. What Are Prepaid Cards? Prepaid cards are issued
by a financial institution that are preloaded with funds and is used like a normal debit card. Prepaid debit cards are generally
network branded (Amex, Discover, MasterCard, Visa) and can be used anywhere the card brand is accepted. Network branded prepaid
cards provide consumers, businesses and governments with the efficiency, security and flexibility of digital payments through a
non-credit payment option and provide the end user security against fraud and theft. While these cards work
like traditional debit/credit cards and offer many of the same fraud and loss protections, they access funds that have been pre-paid
for the cardholder that have been loaded by either the cardholder, another person (as a gift), the government for benefits, employers/corporations
for payroll, or by a corporation for rewards/incentives or health benefits. As a non-credit payment tool, they help the users control
their budget. 4 According to the 2013
Federal Reserve Payments Study, growth in prepaid card payments increased at the fastest rate from 2009 to 2012 when compared to
credit, debit, ACH and checks. In this period prepaid debit transactions grew at a rate of 15.8% annually, reaching 9.2 billion
transactions in 2012. Transactions on prepaid cards have a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 30.7% in the years 2003-2012,
and a CAGR of 15.8% during the 2009 to 2012 time frame. Today, millions of Americans use network
branded prepaid cards for the choice and protection they provide, including the estimated 40 million un-banked or underbanked who
would not otherwise have a way to participate in our card-based economy, parents of college-aged students who want a safe and secure
way to give money without the risk of running up debt, and recipients of government benefits who need an efficient way to receive
their welfare payments, child support payments, food stamps or unemployment payments. Types of Cards This increasingly popular financial
product comes in many forms. Here are some examples to understand how they are used. General Purpose Reloadable:
A type of prepaid card typically purchased by a consumer for his/her personal use to pay for purchases, pay bills and/or access
cash at ATMs. GPR cards may be purchased online and in retail locations from a variety of providers. Funds may be loaded onto the
card by direct deposit of wages or benefits or at retail locations offering prepaid card reload services. Payroll: A Prepaid
Card that is directly or indirectly established through an employer and to which electronic fund transfers of the cardholder's
wages, salary, or other employee compensation (such as commissions), are made on a recurring basis. Corporate Incentive Cards:
Payment made to a consumer or potential consumer as an incentive to, or reward for purchasing a product or completing a task, such
as completing a survey or test driving a vehicle. Payments can also be made by a company to an employee or agent as an incentive
bonus. Health Care: Pre-tax
Benefit cards linked to Health Savings Accounts (HSA), Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA) or Healthcare Reimbursement Accounts (HRA);
funds can be used to pay for current or future medical expenses. Government Disbursement
Cards: Prepaid cards used for the purpose of disbursing government payments such as Social Security payments, disability payments,
disaster relief payments, WIC or Food Stamp disbursements or government payroll. Gift Cards: A prepaid card that is purchased
by a gift giver to be given to a gift recipient. Business Travel and Expense Cards: With
the current credit crisis, businesses no longer can rely on their employees to carry their company travel and field expenses on
their personal credit cards. Many employees no longer have the credit line limits to accommodate company expenses. This has created
a significant opportunity in the business expense management market. 5 Our Products and Services We are a vertically integrated payment
processor and debit card program manager offering innovative payment solutions to corporations, government agencies, universities
and other organizations. Our payment solutions are utilized by our customers as a means to increase customer loyalty, reduce administration
costs and streamline operations. We market our prepaid debit card solutions under our PaySign ® brand. As we are
a payment processor and debit card program manager, we derive our revenue from all stages of the debit card lifecycle. These revenues
can include fees from program set-up; customization and development; data processing and report generation; card production and
fulfillment; transaction fees derived from card usage; inactivity fees; card replacement fees and program administration fees.
We provide an in-house customer service center which includes live bi-lingual phone operators staffed 24/7 for incoming calls.
We also run in-house Interactive Voice Response (IVR) and two way SMS messaging platforms. Our cards are offered to end users
through our relationships with bank issuers. In the first several years of our existence
we focused mainly on providing co-pay assistance prepaid cards to the pharmaceutical industry. In 2011, we developed a prepaid
card based payment solution for the source plasma collection industry. In recent months, having built the necessary infrastructure
and adding essential staff, we have increased our focus and sales efforts on corporate incentive prepaid solutions. This market
segment is expected to grow to $19.5 billion by 2016, according to First Annapolis Consulting. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we
added 19 corporate incentive reward programs to our platform. As of December 31, 2014 we managed 78 such programs, up from 46 as
of year-end 2013. These programs tend to have high gross margins and predictable usage patterns. The PaySign Brand In order to leverage the capabilities
of the PaySign platform and successfully expand our product offerings to additional, non-healthcare related verticals, we established
the PaySign brand of prepaid cards and prepaid solutions. The PaySign brand will encompass the entirety of our prepaid product
offerings, including but not limited to: corporate incentives (including healthcare and non-healthcare markets), payroll, settlement
payments, and solutions designed for the public sector. PaySign is a registered trademark of 3PEA Technologies,Inc. in the United
States and other countries, Incentive Rewards Our PaySign corporate incentive cards
offer businesses a practical and contemporary way to reward and motivate existing and potential customers, employees, donors and
participants of clinical trials, sales professionals, agents and distributors. The PaySign Card is accepted anywhere Visa is accepted.
Key benefits of our corporate incentive cards are: · Cost savings Operating and administrative costs
associated with processing traditional paper checks are reduced. · Co-Branding Our clients can promote their
brands as the card can include the corporate sponsor’s logo. The card itself acts as a wallet sized billboard. 6 · Customization Our PaySign platform allows for
easy customization of our corporate incentive card programs. For example, our clients can select merchants or merchant categories
which dictate where the card will be accepted. Our clients can receive customized reports, track card usage and attach surveys
to the activation process to gain market intelligence. · Speed Our clients can get rewards and
incentives to the intended recipients in a much quicker manner than traditional methods using our corporate incentive programs. We develop incentive card programs that
our customers use for a wide variety of applications, including but not limited to: Consumer rebates for large purchases or frequent
buyers; trade incentives for third party distributors, new product launches and commission based sales incentives; Consumer promotions
such as automobile test drives, purchase incentives, remuneration for time and effort of donating, referral programs, event giveaways
and purchase incentives. Source Plasma Donor Payments Plasma
derived therapies are lifesaving treatments used to treat various rare conditions. In order for plasma based therapies to be produced,
human plasma, must be used in its manufacture. Human Plasma is the yellow liquid portion of whole blood that can be easily replaced
by the body. Plasma makes up approximately 57 percent of whole blood and consists primarily of water and proteins. Source plasma
is the plasma collected from volunteer donors that serves as the raw material for the further manufacturing into these lifesaving
therapies. Historically, source plasma donation centers remunerated their donors with cash or checks. In the past several years,
plasma donation centers have migrated to a prepaid card based solution for donor payments. 3PEA offers a comprehensive customized
payment solution for source plasma collection centers under the PaySign brand. The solution consists of the PaySign Prepaid Debit
Card, the PaySign Connect Portal for administrators, and the PaySign Kiosk. The solution offers customized reporting and provides
a level of business analytics previously unavailable. The solution can be utilized either as a stand-alone web based solution or
integrated with existing donor management systems, giving plasma donation centers an increased level of flexibility Pharmaceutical Market Historically, one of the promotional tools
utilized by pharmaceutical companies has been to provide promotional samples to physicians, which then distribute them to patients.
Our card is intended to replace the distribution of physical samples. Our PaySign Co-Pay Assistance Card is an adjudicated promotional
debit card that reimburses or contributes to the prescription drug purchase with promotional funds at retail pharmacies nationwide. Our prescription solutions provide claims
processing and other administrative services for clients that are conducted online, in real-time, according to client benefit plan
designs. Our solutions present a cost-effective alternative to an in-house pharmacy claims adjudication system by providing real-time
financial incentives for both consumers and payers. Our offerings also allow clients to directly manage more of their pharmacy
benefits and include pharmacy claims adjudication, network and payer administration, client call center service and support, reporting,
rebate management, as well as implementation, training and account management. 7 PaySign Co-Pay Assistance The PaySign Co-Pay Assistance Card is
a promotional pharmaceutical copay or discount card which is adjudicated as a primary or secondary insurance card at the retail
pharmacy location. This primary or secondary adjudication determines what funds will be loaded on to the card by applying business
rules determined by the sponsoring company. The loaded funds are then immediately applied to the prescription purchase at the pharmacy
as a cost offset for the patient. The card may be used to defer part or all the cost of the prescription or any co-pay or deductible,
or any combination thereof that the patient would otherwise have to pay under his or her insurance program or out of pocket to
purchase the drug. The PaySign Co-Pay Assistance Card can be offered as either a straight payment voucher card or a debit card
or a combination of the two. A voucher card is adjudicated just like a debit card, but differs from a debit card in that funds
are remitted to the pharmacy on a monthly or bi-monthly basis, unlike a debit card which is funded at the time of purchase. A voucher
card is used in promotional campaigns where it is not feasible to distribute a card with a magnetic strip, such as newspaper or
magazine ads or inserts. Key features and benefits of the PaySign Co-Pay Assistance Card are: · Tracking and auditing "free samples" is no longer required,
as the retail pharmacy network serves as the distribution mechanism for new prescriber promotions. · The patient's primary insurance pays the standard adjudicated amount
for prescription fills that would historically be "free samples," thus turning the distribution of samples into a revenue
generator. · The distribution of cards enables far superior prescriber and patient
data collection for the pharmaceutical company through the use of automated questionnaires required to activate the cards. · The card can be implemented as a secondary insurance card (for private
insurance patients), as a traditional voucher card (for Medicare patients), or as both on the same card. · The marketing programs can be better designed exactly to meet the
specifications and needs of the sponsoring pharmaceutical company, as compared to programs involving the distribution of physical
samples. · Because the card operates like a debit card, pharmacy retailers are
paid instantly for the adjudicated promotional cost on covered prescription transactions. · We provide a set of comprehensive, customizable reporting modules to
our pharmaceutical clients. Buy and Bill Where PaySign’s standard co-pay
assistance card provides payment for self-administered pharmaceuticals purchased at a pharmacy, PaySign’s Buy and Bill programs
are designed to provide a benefit for patients when purchasing directly from their physician’s office or through an infusion
center for physician administered therapies . 8 Other Products Survey Instant Rewards We offer a Survey Instant Rewards card
program to organizations interested in gathering survey data, particularly for companies that have difficulty locating and inducing
qualified consumers to provide survey data for market research. The Survey Instant Rewards card program provides a better approach
to survey collection and market research by utilizing financial debit card technology to offer targeted survey respondents immediate
financial rewards for completing market research surveys. We provide consumer product and service
companies with a simple and powerfully effective turnkey solution for collecting valuable market information about customers, competitors,
and markets. With a Survey Instant Rewards Program, the client mails a survey recipient an unloaded debit card and invites him
or her to take your online or phone based survey. When his survey is complete, the card is automatically loaded with the incentive
reward, which the recipient can immediately redeem at the nearest ATM machine or point of sale location. Key features and benefits of Survey
Instant Rewards card program are: · The immediacy of the reward, combined with the tangible nature of
the physical debit card in the hand of the recipient, produces a powerful motivator for individuals to answer a few questions. · The program is ideal for all size survey projects. · We provide a complete turnkey solution, and an ability to integrate
our debit card features into the client's existing survey collection capabilities. · The programs can be quickly customized and implemented, and the results
are immediately available online and in real time. · The programs are extremely fast and efficient at collecting valuable
information, resulting in vastly improved response rates and dramatically lower overall survey collection time than programs that
use other common methods of reward, including coupons and mail in rebates. · Increased survey response rates lower overall survey cost. Customer Service Center In order to provide a full range of
services to our customers, we offer a fully staffed, in-house Customer Service Center which is operational 24 hours a day, 7 days
per week consisting of live bi-lingual phone operators for incoming calls. The PaySign Platform provides an Interactive Voice Response
(IVR), SMS alerts and two way SMS messaging, allowing cardholders to set alerts and check their balances and history without the
assistance of a live customer service operator. We believe our in-house customer service center provides the highest quality customer
service experience for our clients as training is performed on-site by 3PEA staff, and the center performs customer service solely
for our products and card programs. 9 Other Markets We have identified a variety of other
markets that our debit cards can be used, such as; corporate incentive or reimbursement programs, gift cards, payroll payments,
government benefit payments, parental control, travel and per diem, and as a reloadable debit card for use by consumers without
a traditional bank account. Technology Our technology platform employs a standard
enterprise services bus in a service-oriented architecture, configured for 24/7 operations. We maintain two secure, interconnected,
environmentally-controlled data centers, one is a primary data center in Las Vegas, Nevada, with emergency power generation capabilities,
and one is a back-up data center in the Las Vegas metro area. We use a variety of proprietary and licensed standards-based technologies
to implement our platforms, including those which provide for orchestration, interoperability and process control. The platforms
also integrate a data infrastructure to support both transaction processing and data warehousing for operational support and data
analytics. Competition The markets for financial products and
services, including SVCs and services related thereto, are intensely competitive. We compete with a variety of companies in our
markets and our competitors vary in size, scope and breadth of products and services offered. Certain segments of the financial
services and healthcare industries tend to be highly fragmented, with numerous companies competing for market share. Highly fragmented
segments currently include financial account processing, customer relationship management solutions, electronic funds transfer
and SVC solutions. In addition to competition from other companies, we face competition from existing and potential clients who
already have or may develop their own product offerings. Many of our existing and potential competitors
have longer operating histories, greater financial strength and more recognized brands in the industry. These competitors may be
able to attract customers more easily because of their financial resources and awareness in the market. Our larger competitors
can also devote substantially more resources to business development and may adopt more aggressive pricing policies. To compete
with these companies, we rely primarily on direct marketing strategies including strategic marketing partners. In our pharmaceutical sampling business, we
believe that McKesson, Emdeon and Trial Card have programs to enable to enable pharmaceutical companies to distribute vouchers
or cards in lieu of physical samples. In the source plasma business, we believe that Citi Prepaid has programs to enable reimbursement
of reward card products. Sales and Marketing We primarily market our products and
services through direct marketing by the Company’s sales executives. We also utilize independent contractors who make direct
sales for us and other companies and are paid on a commission basis only. We market our pharmaceutical sampling cards directly
to pharmaceutical firms and through advertising/marketing agencies used by the pharmaceutical firms. Markets and Major Customers We have no major customers and we are
not reliant on any program. We manage multiple programs at any given time, consisting of millions of cards under management. 10 Regulation Introduction We operate in a highly regulated environment
and are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination. Applicable laws and regulations may change, and there is
no assurance that such changes will not adversely affect our business. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in
connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including but not limited to the imposition of restrictions on the
operation of financial institutions we may work with. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of
restrictions on activities, regulatory policy, regulations, or legislation, including but not limited to changes in the regulations
governing banks, could have a material impact on our operations. Our products and services are generally
subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations, including: · anti-money laundering laws; · money transfer and payment instrument licensing regulations; · escheatment laws; · privacy and information safeguard laws; · bank regulations; · consumer protection laws; and · false claims laws and other fraud and abuse restrictions. · privacy and security standards under HIPAA or other laws These laws are often evolving and sometimes
ambiguous or inconsistent, and the extent to which they apply to us or the banks that issue our cards, our clients or our third
party service providers is at times unclear. Any failure to comply with applicable law — either by us or by the card
issuing banks, our client or our third party service providers, over which we have limited legal and practical control —
could result in restrictions on our ability to provide our products and services, as well as the imposition of civil fines and
criminal penalties and the suspension or revocation of a license or registration required to sell our products and services. See
"Risk Factors" for additional discussion regarding the potential impacts of changes in laws and regulations to which
we are subject and failure to comply with existing or future laws and regulations. We continually monitor and enhance our
compliance program to stay current with the most recent legal and regulatory changes. We also continue to implement policies and
programs and to adapt our business practices and strategies to help us comply with current legal standards, as well as with new
and changing legal requirements affecting particular services or the conduct of our business generally. 11 Anti-Money Laundering Laws Our products and services are generally
subject to federal anti-money laundering laws, including the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act, and similar state
laws. On an ongoing basis, these laws require us, among other things, to: · report large cash transactions and suspicious activity; · screen transactions against the U.S. government's watch-lists,
such as the watch-list maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control; · prevent the processing of transactions to or from certain countries,
individuals, nationals and entities; · identify the dollar amounts loaded or transferred at any one time
or over specified periods of time, which requires the aggregation of information over multiple transactions; · gather and, in certain circumstances, report customer information; · comply with consumer disclosure requirements; · register or obtain licenses with state and federal agencies in the
United States and seek registration of any retail distributors when necessary. Anti-money laundering regulations are
constantly evolving. We continuously monitor our compliance with anti-money laundering regulations and implement policies and procedures
to make our business practices flexible, so we can comply with the most current legal requirements. We cannot predict how these
future regulations might affect us. Complying with future regulation could be expensive or require us to change the way we operate
our business. Money Transfer and Payment Instrument
Licensing Regulations We are not currently subject to money
transfer and payment instrument licensing regulations; however, we have plans to introduce products in the future that would be
subject to such regulations. Currently, we believe that 39 U.S. jurisdictions would require us to obtain a license to operate
a money transfer business. As a licensee, we would be subject to certain restrictions and requirements, including reporting, net
worth and surety bonding requirements and requirements for regulatory approval of controlling stockholders, agent locations and
consumer forms and disclosures. We would also subject to inspection by the regulators in the jurisdictions in which we are licensed,
many of which conduct regular examinations. In addition, we would be required to maintain "permissible investments" in
an amount equivalent to all "outstanding payment obligations." Escheatment Laws Unclaimed property laws of every U.S. jurisdiction
require that we track certain information on our card products and services and that, if customer funds are unclaimed at the end
of an applicable statutory abandonment period, the proceeds of the unclaimed property be remitted to the appropriate jurisdiction. 12 Privacy and Information Safeguard
Laws In the ordinary course of our business,
we or our third party service providers collect certain types of data, which subjects us to certain privacy and information security
laws in the United States, including, for example, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, or the GLB Act, and other laws or rules
designed to regulate consumer information and mitigate identity theft. We are also subject to privacy laws of various states. These
state and federal laws impose obligations with respect to the collection, processing, storage, disposal, use and disclosure of
personal information, and require that financial institutions have in place policies regarding information privacy and security.
In addition, under federal and certain state financial privacy laws, we must provide notice to consumers of our policies and practices
for sharing nonpublic information with third parties, provide advance notice of any changes to our policies and, with limited exceptions,
give consumers the right to prevent use of their nonpublic personal information and disclosure of it to unaffiliated third parties.
Certain state laws may, in some circumstances, require us to notify affected individuals of security breaches of computer databases
that contain their personal information. These laws may also require us to notify state law enforcement, regulators or consumer
reporting agencies in the event of a data breach, as well as businesses and governmental agencies that own data. In order to comply
with the privacy and information safeguard laws, we have confidentiality/information security standards and procedures in place
for our business activities and with our third-party vendors and service providers. Privacy and information security laws evolve
regularly, requiring us to adjust our compliance program on an ongoing basis and presenting compliance challenges. Bank Regulations All of the cards that we service are
issued by a state-chartered bank. Thus, we are subject to the oversight of the regulators for, and certain laws applicable to,
these card issuing banks. These banking laws require us, as a servicer to the banks that issue our cards, among other things, to
undertake compliance actions similar to those described under "– Anti-Money Laundering Laws" above and to
comply with the privacy regulations promulgated under the GLB Act as discussed under "– Privacy and Information
Safeguard Laws" above. Consumer Protection Laws Certain products that we anticipate
introducing in the future would be subject to state and federal consumer protection laws, including laws prohibiting unfair and
deceptive practices, regulating electronic fund transfers and protecting consumer nonpublic information. Before we introduce those
products, we will have to develop appropriate procedures for compliance with these consumer protection laws. Card Associations In order to provide our products and
services, we, as well as the banks that issue our cards, must be registered with Visa and MasterCard, as well as any other networks
that we desire to use, such as Pulse, NYCE and Star, and, as a result, are subject to card association rules that could subject
us to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the card association or network for certain acts or omissions. The
banks that issue our cards are specifically registered as "members" of the Visa and/or MasterCard card associations.
Visa and MasterCard set the standards with which we and the card issuing banks must comply. False Claims Laws and Other Fraud
and Abuse Restrictions We provide claims processing and other
transaction services to pharmaceutical companies that relate to, or directly involve, the reimbursement of pharmaceutical costs
covered by Medicare, Medicaid, other federal healthcare programs and private payers. As a result of these aspects of our business,
we may be subject to, or contractually required to comply with, state and federal laws that govern various aspects of the submission
of healthcare claims for reimbursement and the receipt of payments for healthcare items or services. These laws generally prohibit
an individual or entity from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented claims for payment to Medicare, Medicaid or other
third party payers that are false or fraudulent. False or fraudulent claims include, but are not limited to, billing for services
not rendered, failing to refund known overpayments, misrepresenting actual services rendered in order to obtain higher reimbursement,
improper coding and billing for medically unnecessary goods and services. Many of these laws provide significant civil and criminal
penalties for noncompliance and can be enforced by private individuals through “whistleblower” or qui tam actions.
To avoid liability, providers and their contractors must, among other things, carefully and accurately code, complete and submit
claims for reimbursement. 13 From time to time, constituents in the
healthcare industry, including us, may be subject to actions under the federal False Claims Act or other fraud and abuse provisions.
We cannot guarantee that state and federal agencies will regard any billing errors we process as inadvertent or will not hold us
responsible for any compliance issues related to claims we handle on behalf of providers and payers. Although we believe our editing
processes are consistent with applicable reimbursement rules and industry practice, a court, enforcement agency or whistleblower
could challenge these practices. We cannot predict the impact of any enforcement actions under the various false claims and fraud
and abuse laws applicable to our operations. Even an unsuccessful challenge of our practices could cause adverse publicity and
cause us to incur significant legal and related costs. Privacy and Security Standards under
HIPAA or Other Laws. The Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 contains privacy regulations and the security regulations that apply to some of our operations. The
privacy regulations extensively regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information by entities subject
to HIPAA. For example, the privacy regulations permit parties to use and disclose individually identifiable health information
for treatment and to process claims for payment, but other uses and disclosures, such as marketing communications, require written
authorization from the individual or must meet an exception specified under the privacy regulations. The privacy regulations also
provide patients with rights related to understanding and controlling how their health information is used and disclosed. To the
extent permitted by the privacy regulations, ARRA and our contracts with our customers, we may use and disclose individually identifiable
health information to perform our services and for other limited purposes, such as creating de-identified information. Determining
whether data has been sufficiently de-identified to comply with the privacy regulations and our contractual obligations may require
complex factual and statistical analyses and may be subject to interpretation. The security regulations require certain entities
to implement and maintain administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security of individually identifiable
health information that is electronically transmitted or electronically stored. We have implemented and maintain policies and processes
to assist us in complying with the privacy regulations, the security regulations and our contractual obligations. We cannot provide
assurance regarding how these standards will be interpreted, enforced or applied to our operations. If we are unable to properly
protect the privacy and security of health information entrusted to us, we could be subject to substantial penalties, damages and
injunctive relief. In addition to HIPAA, numerous other
state and federal laws govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to and confidentiality of individually identifiable health
information and healthcare provider information. In addition, some states are considering new laws and regulations that further
protect the confidentiality, privacy and security of medical records or other types of medical information. In many cases, these
state laws are not preempted by the HIPAA privacy regulations and may be subject to interpretation by various courts and other
governmental authorities. Further, the U.S. Congress and a number of states have considered or are considering prohibitions
or limitations on the disclosure of medical or other information to individuals or entities located outside of the United States. 14 Patents and Trademarks We protect our intellectual property
rights through a combination of trademark, patent, copyright and trade secrets laws. In order to limit access to and disclosure
of our proprietary information, all of our employees and consultants have signed confidentiality and we enter into nondisclosure
agreements with third parties. We cannot provide assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights,
however, will deter adequately infringement or misappropriation of those rights. Particularly given the international nature of
the Internet, the rate of growth of the Internet and the ease of registering new domain names, we may not be able to detect unauthorized
use of our intellectual property or take enforcement action . Employees and Independent Contractors At March 9, 2015, we had thirty employees
and independent contractors. We have no collective bargaining agreements
with our employees, and believe all independent contractor and employment agreements relationships are satisfactory. We hire independent
contractors on an as-needed basis, and we may retain additional employees and consultants during the next twelve months, including
additional executive management personnel with substantial experience in pharmaceutical sampling market and development business. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. An investment in our common stock
involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of
the other information in this registration statement, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes included
elsewhere in this prospectus, before deciding to invest in our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our
business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event,
the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. Risks Related to Our Business Our growth rates may decline in the
future. In fiscal 2013, we experienced rapid growth in our corporate incentives solution business. However, this revenue growth
was offset by a reduction in revenue derived from our pharmaceutical sampling card programs. This resulted in a decrease in our
year over year revenue. There can be no assurance that we will be able to resume our historical growth rates in future periods.
In the near term, our continued growth depends in significant part on our ability, among other things, to enter new markets and
to continue to attract new clients, and to retain our current clientele. Our continued growth also depends on our ability to develop
and market other debit card products that can utilize the platform that we have developed for our pharmaceutical sampling business. As the prepaid financial services industry
continues to develop, our competitors may be able to offer products and services that are, or that are perceived to be, substantially
similar to or better than ours. This may force us to compete on the basis of price and to expend significant marketing, product
development and other resources in order to remain competitive. Even if we are successful at increasing our operating revenues
through our various initiatives and strategies, we will experience an inevitable decline in growth rates as our operating revenues
increase to higher levels and we may also experience a decline in margins. If our operating revenue growth rates slow materially
or decline, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. 15 We operate in a highly regulated
environment, and failure by us or business partners to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have an adverse effect
on our business, financial position and results of operations. We operate in a highly regulated environment,
and failure by us or our business partners to comply with the laws and regulations to which we are subject could negatively impact
our business. We are subject to state money transmission licensing requirements and a wide range of federal and other state laws
and regulations, which are described under "Business – Regulation" above. In particular, our products
and services are subject to an increasingly strict set of legal and regulatory requirements intended to protect consumers and to
help detect and prevent money laundering, terrorist financing and other illicit activities. Many
of these laws and regulations are evolving, unclear and inconsistent across various jurisdictions, and ensuring compliance with
them is difficult and costly. For example, with increasing frequency, federal and state regulators are holding businesses like ours to higher standards of training, monitoring and compliance,
including monitoring for possible violations of laws by the businesses that participate in our reload network. Failure by us or
those businesses to comply with the laws and regulations to which we are subject could result in fines, penalties or limitations
on our ability to conduct our business, or federal or state actions, any of which could significantly harm our reputation with
consumers and other network participants, banks that issue our cards and regulators, and could materially and adversely affect
our business, operating results and financial condition. Changes in the laws, regulations, credit card association
rules or other industry standards affecting our business may impose costly compliance burdens and negatively impact our business. There may be changes in the laws, regulations,
card association rules or other industry standards that affect our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways.
Changes to statutes, regulations or industry standards, including interpretation and implementation of statutes, regulations or
standards, could increase the cost of doing business or affect the competitive balance. For example, more stringent anti-money
laundering regulations could require the collection and verification of more information from our customers, which could have a
material adverse effect on our operations. Regulation of the payments industry has increased significantly in recent years. A number
of regulations impacting the credit card industry were recently implemented. Additional changes may require us to incur significant
expenses to redevelop our products. Also, failure to comply with laws, rules and regulations or standards to which we are subject,
including with respect to privacy and data use and security, could result in fines, sanctions or other penalties, which could have
a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations, as well as damage our reputation. A data security breach could expose
us to liability and protracted and costly litigation, and could adversely affect our reputation and operating revenues. We, the banks that issue our cards and
our third party service providers receive, transmit and store confidential customer and other information in connection with our
products and services. The encryption software and the other technologies we and our partners use to provide security for storage,
processing and transmission of confidential customer and other information may not be effective to protect against data security
breaches. The risk of unauthorized circumvention of our security measures has been heightened by advances in computer capabilities
and the increasing sophistication of hackers. The banks that issue our cards, our clients and our third-party processors also may
experience similar security breaches involving the receipt, transmission and storage of our confidential customer and other information.
Improper access to our or these third parties' systems or databases could result in the theft, publication, deletion or modification
of confidential customer and other information. 16 A data security breach of the systems
on which sensitive cardholder data and account information are stored could lead to fraudulent activity involving our products
and services, reputational damage and claims or regulatory actions against us. If we are sued in connection with any data security
breach, we could be involved in protracted and costly litigation. If unsuccessful in defending that litigation, we might be forced
to pay damages and/or change our business practices or pricing structure, any of which could have a material adverse effect on
our operating revenues and profitability. We would also likely have to pay (or indemnify the banks that issue our cards for) fines,
penalties and/or other assessments imposed by Visa or MasterCard as a result of any data security breach. Further, a significant
data security breach could lead to additional regulation, which could impose new and costly compliance obligations. In addition,
a data security breach at one of the banks that issue our cards or our third party service providers could result in significant
reputational harm to us and cause the use and acceptance of our cards to decline, either of which could have a significant adverse
impact on our operating revenues and future growth prospects. The industry in which we compete
is highly competitive, which could adversely affect our operating revenue growth. A number of other companies provide
debit cards for the pharmaceutical sampling business, including McKesson, Emdeon and Trial Card. We also compete for the marketing
dollars of pharmaceutical companies with other forms of marketing, such as mass media advertising and direct sales. We believe that our existing competitors
have longer operating histories, are substantially larger than we are, may already have or could develop substantially greater
financial and other resources than we have, may offer, develop or introduce a wider range of programs and services than we offer
or may use more effective advertising and marketing strategies than we do to achieve broader brand recognition, customer awareness
and retail penetration. We may also face price competition that results in decreases in the purchase and use of our products and
services. To stay competitive, we may have to increase the incentives that we offer to our marketing partners and decrease the
prices of our products and services, which could adversely affect our operating results. We rely on relationships with card
issuing banks to conduct our business, and our results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected
if we fail to maintain these relationships or we maintain them under new terms that are less favorable to us. Our relationship with various banks
is currently, and will be for the foreseeable future, a critical component of our ability to conduct our business and to maintain
our revenue and expense structure, because we are currently unable to issue our own cards. If we lose or do not maintain existing
banking relationships, we would incur significant switching and other costs and expenses and we and users of our products and services
could be significantly affected, creating contingent liabilities for us. As a result, the failure to maintain adequate banking
relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our agreement
with the bank that issues our cards provide for cost and expense allocations between the parties. Changes in the costs and expenses
that we have to bear under these relationships could have a material impact on our operating expenses. In addition, we may be unable
to maintain adequate banking relationships or renew our agreements with the banks that currently issue our cards under terms at
least as favorable to us as those existing before renewal. 17 We receive important services from
third-party vendors, and replacing them could entail unexpected integration costs Some services relating to our business,
including fraud management and other customer verification services, transaction processing and settlement, pharmacy claims adjudication,
card production and customer service are outsourced to third-party vendors. All of our vendors could be replaced with competitors
if our vender terminated our contract or went out of business. However, in some cases replacing a vendor would entail one-time
integration costs to connect our systems to the successor’s systems, and could result in less advantageous contract terms
for the same service, which could adversely affect our profitability. Changes in credit card association
or other network rules or standards set by Visa and MasterCard, or changes in card association and debit network fees or products
or interchange rates, could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. We and the banks that issue our cards
are subject to Visa and MasterCard, Pulse, NYCE and Star association rules that could subject us to a variety of fines or penalties
that may be levied by the card associations or networks for acts or omissions by us or businesses that work with us. The termination
of the card association registrations held by us or any of the banks that issue our cards or any changes in card association or
other debit network rules or standards, including interpretation and implementation of existing rules or standards, that increase
the cost of doing business or limit our ability to provide our products and services could have an adverse effect on our business,
operating results and financial condition. In addition, from time to time, card associations increase the organization and/or processing
fees that they charge, which could increase our operating expenses, reduce our profit margin and adversely affect our business,
operating results and financial condition. For example, a portion of our operating
revenues is derived from interchange fees. The amount of interchange revenues that we earn is highly dependent on the interchange
rates that Visa and MasterCard set and adjust from time to time. Interchange rates for certain products and certain issuing banks
declined significantly as a result of the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Bill. If interchange rates decline further, whether due to
actions by Visa or MasterCard or future legislation or regulation, we would likely need to change our fee structure to compensate
for lost interchange revenues. To the extent we increase the pricing of our products and services, we might find it more difficult
to acquire consumers and to maintain or grow card usage and customer retention. We also might have to discontinue certain products
or services. As a result, our operating revenues, operating results, prospects for future growth and overall business could be
materially and adversely affected. We may not be able to successfully
manage our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims. In the rapidly developing legal framework,
we rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary
technology. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual
property or may develop software or technology competitive to us. Our competitors may independently develop similar technology,
duplicate our products or services or design around our intellectual property rights. We may have to litigate to enforce and protect
our intellectual property rights, trade secrets and know-how or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability, which is
expensive and could cause a diversion of resources and may not prove successful. The loss of intellectual property protection or
the inability to secure or enforce intellectual property protection could harm our business and ability to compete. 18 We may also be subject to costly litigation
in the event our products and technology infringe upon another party’s proprietary rights. Third parties may have, or may
eventually be issued, patents that would be infringed by our products or technology. Any of these third parties could make a claim
of infringement against us with respect to our products or technology. We may also be subject to claims by third parties for breach
of copyright, trademark or license usage rights. Any such claims and any resulting litigation could subject us to significant liability
for damages. An adverse determination in any litigation of this type could require us to design around a third party’s patent
or to license alternative technology from another party. In addition, litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and
could result in the diversion of the time and attention of our management and employees. Any claim from third parties may result
in limitations on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims. As of December, 31, 2013, we had not received
any notice or claim of infringement from any party. Additional equity or debt financing
may be dilutive to existing stockholders or impose terms that are unfavorable to us or our existing stockholders. We may raise capital in order to repay
indebtedness and provide working capital for our expansion into other products and services using our payments platform. If we
raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders will experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, may
involve arrangements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional
debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms,
such as liquidation and other preferences that are not favorable to us or our current stockholders. If we raise additional funds
through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies
and products or grant unfavorable license terms. We depend on key personnel and could
be harmed by the loss of their services because of the limited number of qualified people in our industry. Because of our small size, we require
the continued service and performance of our management team, sales and technology employees, all of whom we consider to be key
employees. Competition for highly qualified employees in the financial services and healthcare industry is intense. Our success
will depend to a significant degree upon our ability to attract, train, and retain highly skilled directors, officers, management,
business, financial, legal, marketing, sales, and technical personnel and upon the continued contributions of such people. In addition,
we may not be able to retain our current key employees. The loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel and our failure
to attract additional highly qualified personnel could impair our ability to expand our operations and provide service to our customers. Our future success depends on our
ability to attract, integrate, retain and incentivize key personnel. Our future success will depend, to a
significant extent, on our ability to attract, integrate, retain and incentivize key personnel, namely our management team and
experienced sales, marketing and program and systems management personnel. We must retain and motivate existing personnel, and
we must also attract, assimilate and motivate additional highly-qualified employees. We may experience difficulty assimilating
our newly-hired personnel, which may adversely affect our business. Competition for qualified management, sales, marketing and
program and systems management personnel can be intense. Competitors have in the past and may in the future attempt to recruit
our top management and employees. If we fail to attract, integrate, retain and incentivize key personnel, our ability to manage
and grow our business could be harmed. 19 Security and privacy breaches of
our electronic transactions may damage customer relations and inhibit our growth. Any failures in our security and privacy
measures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we do not currently
store personal information about consumers, some of the products we are contemplating offering in the future would require that
we store personal information, including birth dates, addresses, bank account numbers, credit card information, social security
numbers and merchant account numbers. If we are unable to protect this information, or if consumers perceive that we are unable
to protect this information, our business and the growth of the electronic commerce market in general could be materially adversely
affected. A security or privacy breach may: · cause our customers to lose confidence in our services; · deter consumers from using our services; · harm our reputation; · require that we expend significant additional resources related to our information security systems
and could result in a disruption of our operations; · expose us to liability; · increase expenses related to remediation costs; and · decrease market acceptance of electronic commerce transactions and SVC use. Although management believes that we
have utilized proven applications designed for premium data security and integrity in electronic transactions, our use of these
applications may be insufficient to address changing market conditions and the security and privacy concerns of existing and potential
customers. The market for electronic commerce
services is evolving and may not continue to develop or grow rapidly enough for us to become profitable. If the number of electronic commerce
transactions does not continue to grow or if consumers or businesses do not continue as projected to adopt our products and services,
it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Management believes future
growth in the electronic commerce market will be driven by the cost, ease of use and quality of products and services
offered to consumers and businesses. In order to reach and thereafter maintain our profitability, consumers and businesses must
continue to adopt our products and services. The debit card and SVC industry is a fairly new industry
that is developing and building standards, processes and relationships. We are a developmental company building
our networks and relationships. In the course of this development of our network, relationships, load locations and related systems,
there exists the possibility that the associated companies may delay roll-out of our products and services. These delays
could have an adverse effect on cash flow, sales and inventory levels. 20 If we do not respond to rapid technological
change or changes in industry standards, our products and services could become obsolete and we could lose our customers. If competitors introduce new products
and services, or if new industry standards and practices emerge, our existing product and service offerings, technology and systems
may become obsolete. Further, if we fail to adopt or develop new technologies or to adapt our products and services to emerging
industry standards, we may lose current and future customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations. The electronic commerce industry is changing rapidly. To remain competitive, we must continue
to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our products, services and technologies. Changes in the Bank Secrecy Act and/or
the USA PATRIOT Act could impede our ability to circulate cards that can be easily loaded or issued. Our current compliance program and screening
process for the distribution and/or sale of SVCs is designed to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) and the
Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act (the “USA
PATRIOT Act”). These regulations require financial institutions to obtain and confirm information related to their
respective cardholders. If the BSA and/or the USA PATRIOT Act or subsequent legislation increases the level of scrutiny that we
must apply to our cardholders and customers, it may be costly or impractical for us to continue to profitably issue and load cards
for our customers. Internal processing errors could
result in our failing to appropriately reflect transactions in customer accounts. In the event of a system failure that
goes undetected for a substantial period of time, we could allow transactions on blocked accounts, confirm false authorizations,
fail to deduct charges from accounts or fail to detect systematic fraud or abuse. Errors or failures of this nature could adversely
impact our operations, our credibility and our financial standing. Our business is dependent on the
efficient and uninterrupted operation of computer network systems and data centers. Our ability to provide reliable service
to our clients and cardholders depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer network systems and data centers
as well as those of our third party service providers. Our business involves movement of large sums of money, processing of large
numbers of transactions and management of the data necessary to do both. Our success depends upon the efficient and error-free
handling of the money. We rely on the ability of our employees, systems and processes and those of the banks that issue our cards,
our third party service providers to process and facilitate these transactions in an efficient, uninterrupted and error-free manner. In the event of a breakdown, a catastrophic
event (such as fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure or physical break-in), a security breach or malicious
attack, an improper operation or any other event impacting our systems or processes, or those of our vendors, or an improper action
by our employees, agents or third-party vendors, we could suffer financial loss, loss of customers, regulatory sanctions and damage
to our reputation. The measures we have taken, including the implementation of disaster recovery plans and redundant computer systems,
may not be successful, and we may experience other problems unrelated to system failures. We may also experience software defects,
development delays and installation difficulties, any of which could harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential
liability and increased operating expenses. We currently do not carry business interruption insurance. 21 Difficult conditions in the economy
generally may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations, and we do not expect these conditions to improve
in the near future. Our results of operations are materially
affected by conditions in the economy generally. The capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption
for more than twelve months at unprecedented levels. Recently, concerns over inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues, the
availability and cost of credit, the U.S. mortgage market and a declining U.S. real estate market have contributed to increased
volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and consumer spending. These factors in declining business and consumer
confidence and increased unemployment, have precipitated an economic slowdown and national recession. These events and the continuing
market upheavals may have an adverse effect on us because we are dependent upon customer and consumer behavior. Our revenues are
likely to decline in such circumstances. In addition, in the event of extreme and prolonged market events, such as the global credit
crisis, we could incur significant losses. Factors such as consumer spending, business
investment, the volatility and strength of the capital markets, and inflation all affect the business and economic environment
and, ultimately, the amount and profitability of our business. In an economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment, lower
family income, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment and lower consumer spending, the demand for our SVC products
and services could be adversely affected. Adverse changes in the economy could affect our results negatively and could have a material
adverse effect on our business and financial condition. The current mortgage crisis and economic slowdown has also raised the possibility
of future legislative and regulatory actions that could further impact our business. We cannot predict whether or when such actions
may occur, or what impact, if any, such actions could have on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The soundness of other institutions and companies could
adversely affect us. Our ability to engage in loading and
purchasing transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and failure of other institutions and companies, our card issuing
banks and distributors that carry our SVCs. As such, we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties.
As a result, defaults by, or even questions or rumors about, one or more of these institutions or companies could lead to losses
or defaults by us or other institutions. Losses related to these defaults or failures could materially and adversely affect our
results of operations. A prolonged economic downturn could
reduce our customer base and demand for our products. We are in uncertain economic times,
including uncertainty with respect to financial markets that have been volatile as a result of sub-prime mortgage related and other
matters. Our success significantly depends upon the growth of demand of our products from a growing customer base. If the communities
in which we operate do not grow, or if prevailing economic conditions locally, nationally or internationally are unfavorable, our
business may not succeed. A prolonged economic downturn would likely contribute to the deterioration of the demand for SVC’s
and our products and services, which in turn would hurt our business. A prolonged economic downturn could, therefore, result in
losses that could materially and adversely affect our business. 22 Risks Related to Our Common Stock There Is A Limited Market For Our Common Stock. The trading market for our common stock
is limited. Our common stock is dual listed on the OTCQB and OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol “TPNL” and is not
eligible for trading on any national or regional securities exchange or the NASDAQ National Market. A more active trading market
for our common stock may never develop, or if such a market develops, it may not be sustained. Our Common Stock is Subject to the
"Penny Stock" Rules of the SEC and the Trading Market in Our Securities is Limited, Which Makes Transactions in Our Stock
Cumbersome and May Reduce the Value of an Investment in Our Stock. The Securities and Exchange Commission
has adopted Rule 15g-9 which establishes the definition of a "penny stock," for the purposes relevant to us, as any equity
security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to
certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require: · that a broker or dealer approve a person's
account for transactions in penny stocks; and · the broker or dealer receive from the
investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased. In order to approve a person's account
for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must: · obtain financial information and investment
experience objectives of the person; and · make a reasonable determination that the
transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters
to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks. The broker or dealer must also deliver,
prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the Commission relating to the penny stock market,
which, in highlight form: · sets forth the basis on which the broker
or dealer made the suitability determination; and · that the broker or dealer received a signed,
written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction. Generally, brokers may be less
willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the "penny stock" rules. This may make it more difficult for
investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our stock. Disclosure also has to be made about
the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both
the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available
to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price
information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. 23 Concentration of ownership among
our existing directors, executive officers and principal stockholders may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate
decisions. Our current directors, executive
officers, holders of more than 5% of our total shares of common stock outstanding and their respective affiliates will, in
the aggregate, beneficially own approximately 71.8% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders will be
able to exercise a controlling influence over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and
approval of significant corporate transactions, and will have significant influence over our management and policies for the
foreseeable future. Some of these persons or entities may have interests that are different from yours. For example, these
stockholders may support proposals and actions with which you may disagree or which are not in your interests. The
concentration of ownership could delay or prevent a change in control of our company or otherwise discourage a potential
acquirer from attempting to obtain control of our company, which in turn could reduce the price of our common stock. In
addition, these stockholders, some of which have representatives sitting on our board of directors, could use their voting
control to maintain our existing management and directors in office, delay or prevent changes of control of our company, or
support or reject other management and board of director proposals that are subject to stockholder approval, such as
amendments to our employee stock plans and approvals of significant financing transactions. Our stock price could decline due
to the large number of outstanding shares of our common stock eligible for future sale. We have outstanding 36,931,606 shares
of our common stock, assuming no exercise of outstanding options or warrants. None of the shares are subject to any lock-up agreements,
and all are eligible for sale, subject in some cases to volume and other restrictions imposed by Rule 144. Sales of substantial
amounts of our common stock in the public market, or even the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the trading
price of our common stock to decline. These sales could also make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities
in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate. We Will Incur Significant Costs As
A Result Of Operating As A Public Company. We May Not Have Sufficient Personnel For Our Financial Reporting Responsibilities, Which
May Result In The Untimely Close Of Our Books And Record And Delays In The Preparation Of Financial Statements And Related Disclosures. As a registered public company, we will
experience an increase in legal, accounting and other expenses. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley
Act”), as well as new rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, has imposed various requirements on public companies, including
requiring changes in corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of
time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs
and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies additional deficiencies in our internal control over
financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject
to sanctions or investigations by the SEC and other regulatory authorities. 24 Our operating results may fluctuate
in the future, which could cause our stock price to decline. Our quarterly and annual results of
operations may fluctuate in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. If our results
of operations fall below the expectations of investors or any securities analysts who follow our common stock, the trading price
of our common stock could decline substantially. Fluctuations in our quarterly or annual results of operations may be due to a
number of factors, including, but not limited to: · the timing and volume of purchases, use
and reloads of our prepaid cards and related products and services; · the timing and success of new product
or service introductions by us or our competitors; · seasonality in the purchase or use of
our products and services; · reductions in the level of interchange
rates that can be charged; · fluctuations in customer retention rates; · changes in the mix of products and services
that we sell; · changes in the mix of retail distributors
through which we sell our products and services; · the timing of commencement, renegotiation
or termination of relationships with significant our third party service providers; · changes in our or our competitors' pricing
policies or sales terms; · the timing of commencement and termination
of major advertising campaigns; · the timing of costs related to the development
or acquisition of complementary businesses; · the timing of costs of any major litigation
to which we are a party; · the amount and timing of operating costs
related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure; · our ability to control costs, including
third-party service provider costs; · volatility in the trading price of our
common stock, which may lead to higher stock-based compensation expenses or fluctuations in the valuations of vesting equity; and · changes in the regulatory environment
affecting the banking or electronic payments industries generally or prepaid financial services specifically. 25 Our revenues from our pharmaceutical
marketing cards fluctuate widely and are difficult to forecast. At present we have two primary lines
of business, corporate reward cards and pharmaceutical marketing cards. Revenues and costs associated with our pharmaceutical marketing
cards fluctuate more widely, and are more difficult to forecast, than other debit card lines of business. Even though a pharmaceutical
card program is created at the direction of a pharmaceutical company, the pharmaceutical company often does not distribute the
cards via their pharmaceutical sales representatives to various end points for distribution until days, weeks or months after
it creates a program, often with little advance warning to the Company. We also experience dramatic usage swings based on collateral
marketing efforts by the pharmaceutical companies, such as print, web, radio and television advertising campaigns that run
in association with one of our card programs. Constant variations in program start and stop dates, variations in program timelines
which range anywhere between six and thirty six months, and variations in program characteristics such as the monetary
value of the load, all contribute to provide dramatic swings in the revenue generated from the programs. As
a result, our revenues and cost of revenues do no correlate neatly to the number of cards in circulation or even the number of
pharmaceutical card programs that are active at any given time. Consequently, it is not the composition of our revenue that causes
the significant swing in revenues from period to period rather; rather, the start, usage and expiration of the pharmaceutical card
program is solely dependent on the timing of marketing programs by the pharmaceutical companies. The growth in our corporate incentive
card programs has partially mitigated this uncertainty, although we do expect to see continued fluctuation in our revenue from
period to period. Over time, we intend to continue to mitigate this uncertainty by offering additional prepaid card products, such
as general spend reloadable, payroll and other types that will help to stabilize and minimize the changes for each period, and
make our results more predictable. The price of our common stock may
be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment. In the recent past, stocks generally,
and financial services company stocks in particular, have experienced high levels of volatility. The trading price of our common
stock may fluctuate substantially. The trading price of our common stock will depend on a number of factors, including those described
in this "Risk Factors" section, many of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance.
These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our common stock as you may be unable to sell your
shares at or above the price you paid. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock include the
following: · price and volume fluctuations in the overall
stock market from time to time; · significant volatility in the market prices
and trading volumes of financial services company stocks; · actual or anticipated changes in our results
of operations or fluctuations in our operating results; · actual or anticipated changes in the expectations
of investors or the recommendations of any securities analysts who follow our common stock; · actual or anticipated developments in
our business or our competitors' businesses or the competitive landscape generally; · the public's reaction to our press releases,
other public announcements and filings with the SEC; · litigation involving us, our industry
or both or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors; · new laws or regulations or new interpretations
of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business; · changes in accounting standards, policies,
guidelines, interpretations or principles; · general economic conditions; and · sales of shares of our common stock by
us or our stockholders. 26 In the past, many companies that have
experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have become subject to securities class action litigation. We may be
the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert
our management's attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business. If securities analysts do not publish
research or reports about our business or if they publish negative evaluations of our common stock, the trading price of our common
stock could decline. We expect that the trading price for
our common stock will be affected by any research or reports that securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one
or more of the analysts who may elect to cover us or our business downgrade their evaluations of our common stock, the price of
our common stock would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company, we could lose visibility
in the market for our common stock, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline. We do not intend to pay dividends
for the foreseeable future. We have never declared or paid any cash
dividends on our capital stock. We intend to retain any earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we
do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, you will likely receive a return on your investment
in our common stock only if the market price of our common stock increases. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS. Because we are a smaller reporting company,
we are not required to provide the information called for by this Item. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES. We lease 9,739 square feet of office space
at 1700 W Horizon Ridge Parkway, Henderson, Nevada 89012, under a lease that runs through April 30, 2015 at a rate of $14,121.55
per month. We lease space for our data centers in Las
Vegas, Nevada under co-location agreements that have typical terms of 36 months. The agreements provide for lease payments of $4,400
per month. We believe that we have satisfactory
title to the properties owned and used in our business, subject to liens for taxes not yet payable, liens incident to minor encumbrances,
liens for credit arrangements and easements and restrictions that do not materially detract from the value of these properties,
our interests in these properties, or the use of these properties in our business. We believe that our properties are adequate
and suitable for us to conduct business in the future. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. The Company is not a party to any material legal proceedings
at this time. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES. Not applicable. 27 PART II ITEM 5. MARKET
FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES. During 2014 and 2013, our common stock
was traded on the OTCQB operated by OTC Markets Group, LLC under the symbol “TPNL”. The company is now fully reporting
and dual listed on the OTCQB and on the OTC Bulletin Board. The following table summarizes the low and high prices for our common
stock for each of the calendar quarters of 2014 and 2013. 2014 2013 High Low High Low First Quarter 0.19 0.14 0.29 0.22 Second Quarter 0.22 0.11 0.33 0.18 Third Quarter 0.25 0.13 0.33 0.16 Fourth Quarter 0.44 0.19 0.23 0.12 There were 514 shareholders of record
of the common stock as of December 31, 2014. This number does not include an indeterminate number of shareholders whose shares
are held by brokers in “street name.” Our common stock is subject to rules
adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") regulating broker dealer practices in connection with
transactions in "penny stocks." Those disclosure rules applicable to "penny stocks" require a broker dealer,
prior to a transaction in a "penny stock" not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized disclosure document
prepared by the Commission. That disclosure document advises an investor that investment in "penny stocks" can be very
risky and that the investor's salesperson or broker is not an impartial advisor, but rather paid to sell the shares. The disclosure
contains further warnings for the investor to exercise caution in connection with an investment in "penny stocks," to
independently investigate the security, as well as the salesperson the investor is working with and to understand the risky nature
of an investment in this security. The broker dealer must also provide the customer with certain other information and must make
a special written determination that the "penny stock" is a suitable investment for the purchaser, and receive the purchaser's
written agreement to the transaction. Further, the rules require that, following the proposed transaction, the broker provide the
customer with monthly account statements containing market information about the prices of the securities. These disclosure requirements
may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock. Many brokers may be
unwilling to engage in transactions in our common stock because of the added disclosure requirements, thereby making it more difficult
for stockholders to dispose of their shares. 28 Dividend Policy We have not declared any cash dividends
on our Common Stock during our fiscal years ended on December 31, 2014 or 2013. Our Board of Directors has made no determination
to date to declare cash dividends during the foreseeable future, but is not likely to do so. There are no restrictions on our ability
to pay dividends. Securities Issued in Unregistered
Transactions During the 4 th quarter of
2014, we issued 75,000 shares of common stock to an employee related to previously awarded compensation. The shares were issued
pursuant to an exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities During the quarter ended
December 31, 2014, we purchased and retired 2,442,000 shares of our common stock as part of a debt settlement totaling
$666,000 for both principal and interest. ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA. Because we are a smaller reporting company,
we are not required to provide the information called for by this Item. ITEM

provider of innovative prepaid card programs and processing services for corporate, consumer and government applications. Our payment
solutions are utilized by our corporate customers as a means to increase customer loyalty, reduce administration costs and streamline
operations. Public sector organizations can utilize the solutions to disburse public benefits or for internal payments. We market
our prepaid debit card solutions under our PaySign brand. As we are a payment processor and debit card program manager, we derive
our revenue from all stages of the debit card lifecycle. We provide a card processing platform consisting of proprietary systems
and innovative software applications based on the unique needs of our programs. We have extended our processing business capabilities
through our proprietary PaySign platform. We design and process prepaid programs that run on the platform through which our customers
can define the services they wish to offer cardholders. Through the PaySign platform, we provide a variety of services including
transaction processing, cardholder enrollment, value loading, cardholder account management, reporting, and customer service. The PaySign platform was built on modern cross-platform
architecture and designed to be highly flexible, scalable and customizable. The platform has allowed 3PEA to significantly expand
its operational capabilities by facilitating our entry into new markets within the payments space through its flexibility and ease
of customization. The PaySign platform delivers cost benefits and revenue building opportunities to our partners. We have developed prepaid card programs for
corporate and incentive rewards including, but not limited to healthcare reimbursement payments, pharmaceutical co-pay assistance,
donor payments for source plasma and automobile dealership incentives. We are expanding our product offering to include additional
corporate incentive products, payroll cards, general purpose re-loadable cards, travel cards, and expense reimbursement cards.
Our cards are offered to end users through our relationships with bank issuers. We are a vertically integrated payment processor
and debit card program manager offering innovative payment solutions to corporations, government agencies, universities and other
organizations. Our payment solutions are utilized by our customers as a means to increase customer loyalty, reduce administration
costs and streamline operations. We market our prepaid debit card solutions under our PaySign brand. As we are a payment processor
and debit card program manager, we derive our revenue from all stages of the debit card lifecycle. These revenues can include
fees from program set-up; customization and development; data processing and report generation; card production and fulfillment;
transaction fees derived from card usage; inactivity fees; card replacement fees and program administration fees. We provide an
in-house customer service center which includes live bi-lingual phone operators staffed 24/7, for incoming calls. We also provide
in house Interactive Voice Response (IVR) and two way SMS messaging platforms. The Company divides prepaid cards into two
general categories: corporate and consumer reloadable, and non-reloadable cards. Reloadable Cards: These types of cards are
generally incentive, payroll or considered general purpose reloadable (“GPR”) cards. Payroll cards are issued to an
employee by an employer to receive the direct deposit of their payroll. GPR cards can also be issued to a consumer at a retail
location or mailed to a consumer after completing an on-line application. GPR cards can be reloaded multiple times with a consumer’s
payroll, government benefit, a federal or state tax refund or through cash reload networks located at retail locations. Reloadable
cards are generally open loop cards as described below. Non-Reloadable Cards: These are generally one-time
use cards that are only active until the funds initially loaded to the card are spent. These types of cards are gift or incentive
cards. These cards may be open loop or closed loop. Normally these types of cards are used for purchase of goods or services at
retail locations and cannot be used to receive cash. 30 These prepaid cards may be open loop, closed
loop or semi-closed loop. Open loop cards can be used to receive cash at ATM locations or purchase goods or services by PIN or
signature at retail locations. These cards can be used virtually anywhere that the network brand (Visa, MasterCard, Discover, etc.)is
accepted. Closed loop cards can only be used at a specific merchant. Semi-closed loop cards can be used at several merchants such
as a shopping mall. The prepaid card market is one of the fastest
growing segments of the payments industry in the U.S. This market has experienced significant growth in recent years due to consumers
and merchants embracing improved technology, greater convenience, more product choices and greater flexibility. Prepaid cards have
also proven to be an attractive alternative to traditional bank accounts for certain segments of the population, particularly those
without, or who could not qualify for, a checking or savings account. We have developed prepaid card programs for
healthcare reimbursement payments, pharmaceutical assistance, plasma donor remuneration, corporate and incentive rewards and expense
reimbursement cards. We plan to expand our product offering to include payroll cards, general purpose re-loadable cards and travel
cards. Our cards are offered to end users through our relationships with bank issuers. Our products and services are aimed at capitalizing
on the growing demand for stored value and reloadable ATM/prepaid card financial products in a variety of market niches. Our proprietary
platform is scalable and customizable, delivering cost benefits and revenue building opportunities to partners. We manage all aspects
of the debit card lifecycle, from managing the card design and approval processes with banking partners and card associations,
to production, packaging, distribution, and personalization. We also oversee inventory and security controls, renewals, lost and
stolen card management and replacement. Currently, we are focusing our marketing efforts
on the healthcare reimbursement market, pharmaceutical marketing or drug sampling market, source plasma donation payments and the
corporate incentive card market targeting automotive and other market niches. As part of our platform expansion development
process, we evaluate current and emerging technologies for applicability to our existing and future software platform. To this
end, we engage with various hardware and software vendors in evaluation of various infrastructure components. Where appropriate,
we use third-party technology components in the development of our software applications and service offerings. Third-party software
may be used for highly specialized business functions, which we may not be able to develop internally within time and budget constraints.
Our principal target markets for processing services include prepaid card issuers, retail and private-label issuers, small third-party
processors, and small and mid-size financial institutions in the United States and in emerging international markets. The company
has begun to devote more extensive resources to sales and marketing activities as we have added essential personnel to our marketing
and sales department in late 2013. We sell our products directly to customers in the U.S. but may work with a small number of
resellers and third parties in international markets to identify, sell and support targeted opportunities. We have also identified
large scale opportunities in the European Union and are aggressively pursuing those opportunities. In order to expand into new markets, we will
need to invest additional funds in technology improvements, sales and marketing expenses, and regulatory compliance costs. We are
considering raising capital to enable us to diversify into new market verticals. If we do not raise new capital, we believe that
we will still be able to expand into new markets using internally generated funds, but our expansion will not be as rapid. 31 Results of Operations In 2014 we increased our focus on sales while
continuing to invest in our core infrastructure, platform development and the addition of essential personnel in order to allow
us to successfully scale our business. To this end, we accomplished the following: · Launched our PaySign brand of prepaid cards. The PaySign brand encompasses our prepaid card solutions for corporate incentives, payroll, public sector, pharmaceutical co-pay assistance source plasma donations, general spend reloadable, and other market niches. · Increased our presence in the plasma donation payments space with the implementation of the PaySign solution for The Interstate Companies and B Positive National Blood Services. During 2014, we increased the number of plasma donation centers using our prepaid solution from 46 in December 31, 2013, to 78 as of December 31, 2014. We expect revenues from these centers to increase as they mature. · Established an Advisory Board and announced that Alexander Goldberg, former President of Ford Motor Land Services Corporation, and Leonard Goodman, Director of Information Technologies at The Interstate Companies, joined the Board. · Partnered with Haemonetics to Integrate our PaySign Connect Prepaid Card solution with Haemonetic's Donor Management System. · Entered into a prepaid card agreement with Visa Inc. whereby we will exclusively issue Visa-branded prepaid cards for the PaySign brand of prepaid cards. · The Board of Directors approved a 2,700,000 share repurchase plan whereby we acquired and retired 2,442,000 shares of common stock in November 2014 as part of a debt settlement totaling $666,000. · Increased our gross profit margins from 35% in 2013 to 55% in 2014. · Continued to provide additional card fulfillment services to our customers. · Identified, researched and targeted large scale business opportunities in the European Union. Fiscal Years Ended December 31, 2014 and
2013 Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014
were $10,293,180, an increase of $3,985,289 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, when revenues were $6,307,891. The increase
in revenue was primarily due to an increase in our corporate incentive reward programs, specifically, our healthcare reimbursement
payments, pharmaceutical co-pay assistance, and donor payments for source plasma. Many of these new corporate incentive reward
programs have been launched under the PaySign® platform which we believe will provide much higher profit margins. Along with
our current programs we are servicing utilizing the PaySign platform, we plan to diversify into other product lines in 2015 such
as corporate incentive card payment programs made to consumers or potential consumers as an incentive to or reward for purchasing
products, and payments made to an employee or agent of a company as an incentive bonus. 32 Cost of revenues for the year ended December
31, 2014 were $4,654,715, an increase of $551,035 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, when cost of revenues were $4,103,680.
Our costs of revenues have increased slightly primarily due to an increase in new corporate incentive reward programs being serviced.
Cost of revenues constituted approximately 45% and 65% of total revenues in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Cost of revenues is comprised
of transaction processing fees, data connectivity and data center expenses, network fees, bank fees, card production costs, customer
service and program management expenses, application integration setup, and sales and commission expense. Gross profit for the year ended December 31,
2014 was $5,638,465, an increase of $3,434,254 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, when gross profit was $2,204,211.
Our overall gross profit percentage approximated 55% and 35% during the fiscal years 2014 and 2013 which is consistent with our
overall expectations. We believe our profit margins will continue to improve in the future as we continue to pursue new corporate
incentive reward programs utilizing our PaySign platform and marketing our products and services utilizing our internal sales and
marketing team. Selling, general and administrative expenses
for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $2,715,316, an increase of $1,238,935 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, when
selling, general and administrative expenses were $1,476,381. During 2014, we recognized approximately $600,000 in stock-based
(non-cash) expenses primarily related to stock grants awarded in August 2012 which vest over a five year period. However, our management
approved the acceleration of such vesting whereby all unvested portion would be fully vested as of December 31, 2014 which resulted
in an increase in stock based expense of $426,000 compared to year ended December 31, 2013 which totaled $180,000. The remaining
increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was due to increased staffing and technological expenses relating to launch
of several new programs. We ramped up our investment in infrastructure and processes to be able to scale our business successfully.
We also had begun to devote more resources to our internal sales and marketing team. In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014,
we recorded operating income of $2,751,555, as compared to operating income of $669,818 in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013,
and improvement of $2,081,737. Other income (expense) for the year ended December
31, 2014 was $(141,515), an increase in net other income (expense) of $82,431 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 of other
income (expenses) of $(59,084). The overall increase in net other income (expense) in 2014 is within our expectations for 2014. Our net income for the year ended December
31, 2014 was $2,610,484, an increase of $1,998,800 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, when we recorded net income of
$611,684. The overall change in net income is attributable to the aforementioned factors. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table sets forth the major sources
and uses of cash for our last two fiscal years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013: Year ended December 31, 2014 2013 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 3,082,535 $ (620,273 ) Net cash (used in) investing activities (527,912 ) (238,779 ) Net cash (used in) financing activities 305,106 13,380 Net increase in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents $ 2,859,729 $ (845,672 ) 33 Comparison of Fiscal 2014 and 2013 In fiscal 2014 and 2013, we financed our operations
primarily through internally generated funds. Operating activities provided (used) $3,082,535
of cash in 2014, as compared to $(620,273) of cash provided in fiscal 2013. Major non-cash items that affected our cash flow from
operations in 2014 were non-cash stock based expenses of $600,641 and depreciation and amortization of $171,594. Our operating
assets and liabilities used $(299,740) of cash, which resulted from a decrease in our payables and accrued liabilities of $(604,586)
and an increase in accounts receivable of $304,953. Investing activities used $(527,912) of cash
in 2014, as compared to $(238,779) of cash used in 2013, all of which related in both years to platform expansion and the purchase
of equipment used in our business. Financing activities provided $305,106 of cash
in 2014 as compared to $13,380 of cash in 2013. Our cash provided by financing activities in 2014 primarily related to proceeds
we received from borrowings during 2014, offset by payments on notes payable. Liquidity and Sources of Financing In both 2014 and 2013, our operations were
focused on developing and launching our PaySign® platform, infrastructure and processes to be able to scale our business successfully
which was financed from operations. We believe that our available cash on hand
at December 31, 2014 of $3,886,968 and revenues anticipated for 2015 will be sufficient to sustain our operations for the next
twelve months. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our significant accounting policies are described
in Note 2 of Notes to Financial Statements. At this time, we are not required to make any material estimates and assumptions that

WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE. During the two fiscal years ended December
31, 2014, we have not filed any Current Report on Form 8-K reporting any change in accountants in which there was a reported disagreement
on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosures or auditing scope or procedure. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. Management’s Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting and Remediation Initiatives Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Mark Newcomer, our chief executive officer,
and Arthur De Joya, our chief financial officer, are responsible for establishing and maintaining our disclosure controls and procedures.
Disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information we are required
to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by us in those reports is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of December
31, 2014. Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of the evaluation
date, such controls and procedures were effective. Changes in internal controls There were no changes in our internal controls
over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2014 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Management's Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting. As defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed by, or under the supervision of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer and implemented
by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 35 Our internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that: · pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; · provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors; and · provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. As of December 31, 2014 we conducted an evaluation,
under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer (our principle executive officer), our chief operating
officer and our chief financial officer (also our principal financial and accounting officer) of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or the COSO Framework. Management's assessment included an evaluation of
the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of those controls. A material weakness is defined within the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board's Auditing Standard No. 5 as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control
over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Based upon this assessment, management concluded that
our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2014. This annual report does not include an attestation
report of the company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s
report was not subject to attestation by the company’s registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the
Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the company to provide only management’s report in this annual report. ITEM 9A(T). controls and

FEES AND SERVICES. In the last two fiscal years ended December

could appear to impair the objectivity of our principal accountants, our board has restricted the non-audit services that our principal
accountants may provide to us primarily to tax services and audit related services. We are only to obtain non-audit services from
our principal accountants when the services offered by our principal accountants are more effective or economical than services
available from other service providers, and, to the extent possible, only after competitive bidding. The board has adopted policies
and procedures for pre-approving work performed by our principal accountants. After careful consideration, the board has
determined that payment of the audit fees is in conformance with the independent status of our principal independent accountants. Audit Fees: The aggregate fees billed for the
fiscal years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 for professional services rendered by the principal accountant for the audit of our
annual financial statements for 2014 and 2013 was $15,000 and $15,000, respectively. Audit-Related Fees: The aggregate fees billed

International, Inc. as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders'
equity, and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of 3PEA International, Inc.'s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were
we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly,
we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of 3PEA International, Inc., as of December 31, 2014 and
December 31, 2013, and the consolidated results of its operations and cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in The United States of America. /s/ Sarna & Company Sarna & Company, Certified Public Accountants Thousand Oaks, California March 25, 2015 F- 3 3PEA INTERNATIONAL, INC.

F- 7 3PEA INTERNATIONAL, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND 2013 (AUDITED) 1. Description of
business, HISTORY and summary of significant policies Description of business – 3PEA
International, Inc. (the “Company” or “3PEA”) was incorporated on August 24, 1995 under the name of Antek
International, Inc. The Company had undergone several name changes which eventually changing it to the name, 3Pea International,
Inc. on October 19, 2006. The Company acquired 3Pea Technologies, Inc., a payment solutions company, in March 2006, which resulted
in 3Pea Technologies, Inc. becoming a wholly owned subsidiary. In September 2007, the Company acquired control
of Wow Technologies, Inc., a payment solutions company with a proprietary card processing platform, in a share exchange agreement
whereby Wow Technologies, Inc. became a subsidiary of 3PEA International, Inc. On October 19, 2006, the Company changed its name
to 3PEA International, Inc. About 3PEA International, Inc. 3PEA International, Inc. is a vertically integrated
provider of innovative prepaid card programs and processing services for corporate, consumer and government applications. Our payment
solutions are utilized by our corporate customers as a means to increase customer loyalty, reduce administration costs and streamline
operations. Public sector organizations can utilize the solutions to disburse public benefits or for internal payments. We market
our prepaid debit card solutions under our PaySign ® brand. As we are a payment processor and debit card program
manager, we derive our revenue from all stages of the debit card lifecycle. We provide a card processing platform consisting of
proprietary systems and innovative software applications based on the unique needs of our programs. We have extended our processing
business capabilities through our proprietary PaySign platform. We design and process prepaid programs that run on the platform
through which our customers can define the services they wish to offer cardholders. Through the PaySign platform, we provide a
variety of services including transaction processing, cardholder enrollment, value loading, cardholder account management, reporting,
and customer service. We have developed prepaid card programs for
healthcare reimbursement payments, pharmaceutical co-pay assistance, plasma donor remuneration and corporate incentive and rewards.
We plan to expand our product offering to include payroll cards, general purpose re-loadable cards, travel cards, and expense reimbursement
cards. Our cards are offered to end users through our relationships with bank issuers. Our proprietary PaySign ® platform
was built on modern cross-platform architecture and designed to be highly flexible, scalable and customizable. The platform allows
3PEA to significantly expand its operational capabilities by facilitating our entry into new markets within the payments space
through its flexibility and ease of customization. The PaySign platform delivers cost benefits and revenue building opportunities
to our partners. We manage all aspects of the debit card lifecycle,
from managing the card design and approval processes with partners and associations, to production, packaging, distribution, and
personalization. We also oversee inventory and security controls, renewals, lost and stolen card management and replacement. We
deploy a fully staffed, in-house customer service department which utilizes bi-lingual customer service agents, Interactive Voice
Response, (IVR) and two SMS messaging. Principles of consolidation –
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated. Year end – The Company’s
year-end is December 31. F- 8 Use of estimates – The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and cash equivalents – The
Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase
to be cash equivalents for the purposes of the statement of cash flows. Cash restricted and Customer card funding – At December 31, 2014 and 2013, cash restricted are funds held specifically for our card programs which we have recorded
a corresponding customer card funding liability in the same amount. Fixed assets – Fixed assets are
stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided principally on the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets, which are generally 3 to 10 years. The cost of repairs and maintenance is charged to expense as incurred.
Expenditures for property betterments and renewals are capitalized. Upon sale or other disposition of a depreciable asset, cost
and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in other income (expense). The Company periodically evaluates whether
events and circumstances have occurred that may warrant revision of the estimated useful life of fixed assets or whether the remaining
balance of fixed assets should be evaluated for possible impairment. The Company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted cash
flows over the remaining life of the fixed assets in measuring their recoverability. Goodwill and intangible assets – Goodwill is the purchase premium after adjusting for the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized
but is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis, or when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment,
at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit, as defined under applicable accounting guidance, is a business segment or one
level below a business segment. We may in any given period bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to a
two-step method to assess and measure impairment of the reporting units goodwill. We first assess qualitative factors to
determine whether it is more likely-than-not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting
unit is less than its carrying value. This step serves as the basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the
two-step quantitative impairment test. The first step of the quantitative impairment test involves a comparison of the
estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the
reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired; however, if the carrying amount
of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, then the second step of the quantitative impairment test must be
performed. The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with its carrying amount to
measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the
amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s
goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that
excess. For intangible assets, we recognize an impairment
loss if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds fair value. The carrying amount of the intangible
asset is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the
asset. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized
on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Fair value of financial instruments –
Under applicable accounting guidance, fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to
transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants on the measurement date. F- 9 We determine the fair values of our financial
instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established under applicable accounting guidance which requires an entity to maximize
the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The following describes the
three-level hierarchy: Level 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices in
active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and liabilities include debt and equity securities. Level 2 – Observable inputs other than
Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other
inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
We currently do not have any assets or liabilities in this category. Level 3 – Unobservable inputs that are
supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the overall fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level
3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management
judgment or estimation. The fair value for such assets and liabilities is generally determined using pricing models, market comparables,
discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques that incorporate the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing
the asset or liability. We currently do not have any assets or liabilities in this category. Earnings per share – Basic
earnings per share exclude any dilutive effects of options, warrants and convertible securities. Basic earnings per share is
computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding common stocks during the applicable period. Diluted earnings per
share is computed using the weighted-average number of common and common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the
period. Common stock equivalent shares are excluded from the computation if their effect is antidilutive. Income taxes – Our income tax
expense is comprised of current and deferred income tax expense. Current income tax expense approximates taxes to be paid or refunded
for the current period. Deferred income tax expense results from the changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the
periods. These gross deferred tax assets and liabilities represent decreases or increases in taxes expected to be paid in the future
because of future reversals of temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and their
basis as reported in our consolidated financial statements. We also recognize deferred tax assets for tax attributes such as net
operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. We record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the
amounts we conclude are more likely-than-not to be realized in the foreseeable future. We recognize and measure income tax benefits
based upon a two-step model: 1) a tax position must be more likely-than-not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits
in order to be recognized, and 2) the benefit is measured as the largest dollar amount of that position that is more likely-than-not
to be sustained upon settlement. The difference between the benefit recognized for a position and the tax benefit claimed on a
tax return is referred to as an unrecognized tax benefit. We accrue income tax related interest and penalties, if applicable, within
income tax expense. We are in the process of filing certain consolidated
tax returns whereby past subsidiary losses are used to offset tax liabilities on current profits. This approach could be challenged
by the IRS and if not accepted, may affect net income and earnings per share. Management believes that the likelihood of the IRS
not accepting such filings is minimal. Revenue and expense recognition –
We recognize revenue when (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement existing, (2) delivery has occurred, (3) our price
to the buyer is fixed or determinable and (4) collectability of the receivables is reasonably assured. We recognize the costs of
these revenues at the time revenue is recognized. Any fees paid up front are deferred until such time such services have been considered
rendered. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, there are no deferred revenues recorded. F- 10 We generate the following types of revenues: Administration and usage fees, charged to our
prepaid card clients when our programs are created, distributed or reloaded. Such revenues are recognized when such services are
performed. Transaction fees, paid by the applicable networks
and passed through by our card issuing banks when our SVCs are used in a purchase or ATM transaction. Such revenues are recognized
when such services are performed. Maintenance, administration, transaction fees,
charged to an SVC and not under any multiple element arrangements. Such revenues are recognized when such services are performed. Program maintenance management fees charged
to our clients. Such revenues are not under any multiple element arrangements and are recognized when such services are performed. Software development and consulting services
to our clients. Such revenues are recognized in accordance with FASB ASC 985-605. The Company records all revenues on gross basis
in accordance with FASB ASC 605-45 since it is the primary obligor and establishes the price in the revenue arrangement. The
Company is currently under no obligation for refunding any fees or has any obligations for disputed claim settlements. Stock-Based Compensation –
Stock based compensation is accounted for using the Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employee Topic of the FASB ASC , which
establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or
services. It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are
based on the fair value of the entity’s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity
instruments. We determine the value of stock issued at the date of grant. We also determine at the date of grant the value of
stock at fair market value or the value of services rendered (based on contract or otherwise) whichever is more readily
determinable. Shares issued to employees are expensed upon
issuance. Stock based compensation for employees is account
for using the Stock Based Compensation Topic of the FASB ASC. We use the fair value method for equity instruments granted to employees
and will use the Black Scholes model for measuring the fair value of options, if issued. The stock based fair value compensation
is determined as of the date of the grant or the date at which the performance of the services is completed (measurement date)
and is recognized over the vesting periods. Advertising costs –
Advertising costs incurred in the normal course of operations are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs – Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. New accounting pronouncements –
In January 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU")
No. 2014-04, Receivables - Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors ("ASU 2014-04"), which intends to clarify
when a creditor should be considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a
consumer mortgage loan such that the loan should be derecognized and the real estate recognized. ASU 2014-04 is effective for annual
periods, and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2014. We will adopt this standard effective
January 1, 2015. Our adoption of ASU 2014-14 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("ASU 2014-09"), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition
guidance under GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred
to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services.
ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required
within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing GAAP. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2016, and interim periods therein, using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective
approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients,
or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption
(which includes additional footnote disclosures). We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2014-09
on our consolidated financial statements and have not yet determined the method by which we will adopt the standard in 2017. F- 11 In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements—Going Concern. The provisions of ASU No. 2014-15 require management to assess
an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently
in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt, (2) require an
evaluation every reporting period including interim periods, (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management’s
plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management’s
plans, (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment
for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The amendments in
this ASU are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter.
The Company is currently assessing the impact of this ASU on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 2.

Goodwillis not amortized but is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis, or when events or circumstances indicate a potentialimpairment, at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit, as defined under applicable accounting guidance, is a business segmentor one level below a business segment. We may in any given period bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to atwo-step method to assess and measure impairment of the reporting units goodwill. We first assess qualitative factors to determinewhether it is more likely-than-not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is lessthan its carrying value. This step serves as the basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitativeimpairment test. The first step of the quantitative impairment test involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of eachreporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carryingamount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired; however, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimatedfair value, then the second step of the quantitative impairment test must be performed. The second step compares the implied fairvalue of the reporting unit&#146;s goodwill with its carrying amount to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The impliedfair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. If thecarrying amount of the reporting unit&#146;s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss isrecognized in an amount equal to that excess.</font></p> <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><font style="font-size: 8pt">&#160;</font></p> <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><font style="font-size: 8pt">For intangibleassets, we recognize an impairment loss if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds fair value.The carrying amount of the intangible asset is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flowsexpected to result from the use of the asset.</font></p> <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><font style="font-size: 8pt">&#160;</font></p> <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><font style="font-size: 8pt">Intangible assetswith finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.</font></p> <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><font style="font-size: 8pt">&#160;</font></p> <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><font style="font-size: 8pt"><u>Fair valueof financial instruments </u>&#150; Under applicable accounting guidance, fair value is defined as the exchange price that wouldbe received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for theasset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.</font></p> <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><font style="font-size: 8pt">&#160;&#160;</font></p> <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><font style="font-size: 8pt">We determinethe fair values of our financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established under applicable accounting guidancewhich requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fairvalue.

Goodwillis not amortized but is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis, or when events or circumstances indicate a potentialimpairment, at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit, as defined under applicable accounting guidance, is a business segmentor one level below a business segment. We may in any given period bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to atwo-step method to assess and measure impairment of the reporting units goodwill. We first assess qualitative factors to determinewhether it is more likely-than-not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is lessthan its carrying value. This step serves as the basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitativeimpairment test. The first step of the quantitative impairment test involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of eachreporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carryingamount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired; however, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimatedfair value, then the second step of the quantitative impairment test must be performed. The second step compares the implied fairvalue of the reporting unit&#146;s goodwill with its carrying amount to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The impliedfair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. If thecarrying amount of the reporting unit&#146;s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss isrecognized in an amount equal to that excess.</font></p> <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><font style="font-size: 8pt">&#160;</font></p> <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><font style="font-size: 8pt">For intangibleassets, we recognize an impairment loss if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds fair value.The carrying amount of the intangible asset is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flowsexpected to result from the use of the asset.</font></p> <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><font style="font-size: 8pt">&#160;</font></p> <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><font style="font-size: 8pt">Intangible assetswith finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.</font></p> <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"></p> <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><font style="font-size: 8pt"><u>Fair valueof financial instruments </u>&#150; Under applicable accounting guidance, fair value is defined as the exchange price that wouldbe received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for theasset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.</font></p> <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><font style="font-size: 8pt">&#160;</font></p> <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"></p> <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><font style="font-size: 8pt">We determinethe fair values of our financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established under applicable accounting guidancewhich requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fairvalue.

ASU2014-04 is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2014. Wewill adopt this standard effective January 1, 2015.

The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promisedgoods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitledfor those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgmentand estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing GAAP. The standard is effectivefor annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods therein, using either of the following transition methods:(i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option toelect certain practical expedients, or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09recognized at the date of adoption (which includes additional footnote disclosures). We are currently evaluating the impact ofour pending adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements and have not yet determined the method by which wewill adopt the standard in 2017.</font></p> <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><font style="font-size: 8pt">&#160;</font></p> <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><font style="font-size: 8pt">In August 2014,the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, <i>Presentation of Financial Statements&#151;Going Concern. </i>The provisions of ASU No. 2014-15require management to assess an entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certainprinciples that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantialdoubt, (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods, (3) provide principles for considering themitigating effect of management&#146;s plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a resultof consideration of management&#146;s plans, (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt isnot alleviated, and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued(or available to be issued). The amendments in this ASU are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, andfor annual periods and interim periods thereafter.

in a share exchange agreement whereby Wow Technologies, Inc. became a subsidiary of 3PEA International, Inc. On October 19, 2006,
the Company changed its name to 3PEA International, Inc. About 3PEA International, Inc. 3PEA International,
Inc. is a vertically integrated provider of innovative prepaid card programs and processing services for corporate, consumer and
government applications. Our payment solutions are utilized by our corporate customers as a means to increase customer loyalty,
reduce administration costs and streamline operations. Public sector organizations can utilize the solutions to disburse public
benefits or for internal payments. We market our prepaid debit card solutions under our PaySign ® brand. As we are
a payment processor and debit card program manager, we derive our revenue from all stages of the debit card lifecycle. We provide
a card processing platform consisting of proprietary systems and innovative software applications based on the unique needs of
our programs. We have extended our processing business capabilities through our proprietary PaySign platform. We design and process
prepaid programs that run on the platform through which our customers can define the services they wish to offer cardholders.
Through the PaySign platform, we provide a variety of services including transaction processing, cardholder enrollment, value
loading, cardholder account management, reporting, and customer service. We have developed
prepaid card programs for healthcare reimbursement payments, pharmaceutical co-pay assistance, plasma donor remuneration and corporate
incentive and rewards. We plan to expand our product offering to include payroll cards, general purpose re-loadable cards, travel
cards, and expense reimbursement cards. Our cards are offered to end users through our relationships with bank issuers. Our proprietary
PaySign ® platform was built on modern cross-platform architecture and designed to be highly flexible, scalable
and customizable. The platform allows 3PEA to significantly expand its operational capabilities by facilitating our entry into
new markets within the payments space through its flexibility and ease of customization. The PaySign platform delivers cost benefits
and revenue building opportunities to our partners. We manage all
aspects of the debit card lifecycle, from managing the card design and approval processes with partners and associations, to production,
packaging, distribution, and personalization. We also oversee inventory and security controls, renewals, lost and stolen card
management and replacement. We deploy a fully staffed, in-house customer service department which utilizes bi-lingual customer
service agents, Interactive Voice Response, (IVR) and two SMS messaging. Principles
of consolidation  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Year end  The Companys year-end is December 31. Use of estimates  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and cash
equivalents  The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months
or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents for the purposes of the statement of cash flows. Cash restricted
and Customer card funding  At December 31, 2014 and 2013, cash restricted are funds held specifically for our card
programs which we have recorded a corresponding customer card funding liability in the same amount. Fixed assets  Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided principally on the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are generally 3 to 10 years. The cost of repairs and maintenance is
charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures for property betterments and renewals are capitalized. Upon sale or other disposition
of a depreciable asset, cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in other
income (expense). The Company periodically
evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that may warrant revision of the estimated useful life of fixed assets
or whether the remaining balance of fixed assets should be evaluated for possible impairment. The Company uses an estimate of
the related undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the fixed assets in measuring their recoverability. Goodwill and
intangible assets  Goodwill is the purchase premium after adjusting for the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill
is not amortized but is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis, or when events or circumstances indicate a potential
impairment, at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit, as defined under applicable accounting guidance, is a business segment
or one level below a business segment. We may in any given period bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to a
two-step method to assess and measure impairment of the reporting units goodwill. We first assess qualitative factors to determine
whether it is more likely-than-not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less
than its carrying value. This step serves as the basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative
impairment test. The first step of the quantitative impairment test involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each
reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying
amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired; however, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated
fair value, then the second step of the quantitative impairment test must be performed. The second step compares the implied fair
value of the reporting units goodwill with its carrying amount to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The implied
fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. If the
carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is
recognized in an amount equal to that excess. For intangible
assets, we recognize an impairment loss if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds fair value.
The carrying amount of the intangible asset is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows
expected to result from the use of the asset. Intangible assets
with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Fair value
of financial instruments  Under applicable accounting guidance, fair value is defined as the exchange price that would
be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the
asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. We determine
the fair values of our financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established under applicable accounting guidance
which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair
value. The following describes the three-level hierarchy: Level 1 
Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and liabilities include debt and
equity securities. Level 2 
Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets
that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the
full term of the assets or liabilities. We currently do not have any assets or liabilities in this category. Level 3 
Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the overall fair value of the
assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments for which the determination of fair value
requires significant management judgment or estimation. The fair value for such assets and liabilities is generally determined
using pricing models, market comparables, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques that incorporate the assumptions
a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. We currently do not have any assets or liabilities in this category. Earnings per
share  Basic earnings per share exclude any dilutive effects of options, warrants and convertible securities. Basic
earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding common stocks during the applicable period. Diluted
earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common and common stock equivalent shares outstanding during
the period. Common stock equivalent shares are excluded from the computation if their effect is antidilutive. Income taxes  Our income tax expense is comprised of current and deferred income tax expense. Current income tax expense approximates
taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period. Deferred income tax expense results from the changes in deferred tax assets
and liabilities during the periods. These gross deferred tax assets and liabilities represent decreases or increases in taxes
expected to be paid in the future because of future reversals of temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities
as measured by tax laws and their basis as reported in our consolidated financial statements. We also recognize deferred tax assets
for tax attributes such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. We record valuation allowances to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amounts we conclude are more likely-than-not to be realized in the foreseeable future. We recognize
and measure income tax benefits based upon a two-step model: 1) a tax position must be more likely-than-not to be sustained based
solely on its technical merits in order to be recognized, and 2) the benefit is measured as the largest dollar amount of that
position that is more likely-than-not to be sustained upon settlement. The difference between the benefit recognized for a position
and the tax benefit claimed on a tax return is referred to as an unrecognized tax benefit. We accrue income tax related interest
and penalties, if applicable, within income tax expense. We are in the
process of filing certain consolidated tax returns whereby past subsidiary losses are used to offset tax liabilities on current
profits. This approach could be challenged by the IRS and if not accepted, may affect net income and earnings per share. Management
believes that the likelihood of the IRS not accepting such filings is minimal. Revenue and
expense recognition  We recognize revenue when (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement existing, (2) delivery
has occurred, (3) our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and (4) collectability of the receivables is reasonably assured.
We recognize the costs of these revenues at the time revenue is recognized. Any fees paid up front are deferred until such time
such services have been considered rendered. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, there are no deferred revenues recorded. We generate the
following types of revenues: Administration
and usage fees, charged to our prepaid card clients when our programs are created, distributed or reloaded. Such revenues are
recognized when such services are performed. Transaction fees,
paid by the applicable networks and passed through by our card issuing banks when our SVCs are used in a purchase or ATM
transaction. Such revenues are recognized when such services are performed. Maintenance,
administration, transaction fees, charged to an SVC and not under any multiple element arrangements. Such revenues are recognized
when such services are performed. Program maintenance
management fees charged to our clients. Such revenues are not under any multiple element arrangements and are recognized when
such services are performed. Software development
and consulting services to our clients. Such revenues are recognized in accordance with FASB ASC 985-605. The Company records
all revenues on gross basis in accordance with FASB ASC 605-45 since it is the primary obligor and establishes the price in the
revenue arrangement. The Company is currently under no obligation for refunding any fees or has any obligations for disputed
claim settlements. Stock-Based
Compensation  Stock based compensation is accounted for using the Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employee Topic of the
FASB ASC , which establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments
for goods or services. It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services
that are based on the fair value of the entitys equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity
instruments. We determine the value of stock issued at the date of grant. We also determine at the date of grant the value of
stock at fair market value or the value of services rendered (based on contract or otherwise) whichever is more readily determinable. Shares issued
to employees are expensed upon issuance. Stock based compensation
for employees is account for using the Stock Based Compensation Topic of the FASB ASC. We use the fair value method for equity
instruments granted to employees and will use the Black Scholes model for measuring the fair value of options, if issued. The
stock based fair value compensation is determined as of the date of the grant or the date at which the performance of the services
is completed (measurement date) and is recognized over the vesting periods. Advertising
costs  Advertising costs incurred in the normal course of operations are expensed as incurred. Research and
development costs  Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. New accounting
pronouncements  In January 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards
Update ("ASU") No. 2014-04, Receivables - Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors ("ASU 2014-04"),
which intends to clarify when a creditor should be considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate
property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan such that the loan should be derecognized and the real estate recognized. ASU
2014-04 is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2014. We
will adopt this standard effective January 1, 2015. Our adoption of ASU 2014-14 is not expected to have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements. In May 2014,
the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("ASU 2014-09"), which supersedes nearly
all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised
goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled
for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment
and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing GAAP. The standard is effective
for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods therein, using either of the following transition methods:
(i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to
elect certain practical expedients, or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09
recognized at the date of adoption (which includes additional footnote disclosures). We are currently evaluating the impact of
our pending adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements and have not yet determined the method by which we
will adopt the standard in 2017. In August 2014,
the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial StatementsGoing Concern. The provisions of ASU No. 2014-15
require management to assess an entitys ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain
principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial
doubt, (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods, (3) provide principles for considering the
mitigating effect of managements plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result
of consideration of managements plans, (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is
not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued
(or available to be issued). The amendments in this ASU are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and
for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this ASU on the Companys
consolidated financial statements.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT POLICIES (Policies) 12 Months Ended Dec. 31, 2014 Accounting Policies [Abstract] Description of business Description
of business  3PEA International, Inc. (the Company or 3PEA) was incorporated on August
24, 1995 under the name of Antek International, Inc. The Company had undergone several name changes which eventually changing

company, in March 2006, which resulted in 3Pea Technologies, Inc. becoming a wholly owned subsidiary. In September
2007, the Company acquired control of Wow Technologies, Inc., a payment solutions company with a proprietary card processing platform,
in a share exchange agreement whereby Wow Technologies, Inc. became a subsidiary of 3PEA International, Inc. On October 19, 2006,
the Company changed its name to 3PEA International, Inc. About 3PEA International, Inc. 3PEA International,
Inc. is a vertically integrated provider of innovative prepaid card programs and processing services for corporate, consumer and
government applications. Our payment solutions are utilized by our corporate customers as a means to increase customer loyalty,
reduce administration costs and streamline operations. Public sector organizations can utilize the solutions to disburse public
benefits or for internal payments. We market our prepaid debit card solutions under our PaySign ® brand. As we are
a payment processor and debit card program manager, we derive our revenue from all stages of the debit card lifecycle. We provide
a card processing platform consisting of proprietary systems and innovative software applications based on the unique needs of
our programs. We have extended our processing business capabilities through our proprietary PaySign platform. We design and process
prepaid programs that run on the platform through which our customers can define the services they wish to offer cardholders.
Through the PaySign platform, we provide a variety of services including transaction processing, cardholder enrollment, value
loading, cardholder account management, reporting, and customer service. We have developed
prepaid card programs for healthcare reimbursement payments, pharmaceutical co-pay assistance, plasma donor remuneration and corporate

management and replacement. We deploy a fully staffed, in-house customer service department which utilizes bi-lingual customer
service agents, Interactive Voice Response, (IVR) and two SMS messaging. Principles of consolidation Principles
of consolidation  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Use of estimates Use of estimates  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash
equivalents  The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months
or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents for the purposes of the statement of cash flows. Cash restricted
and Customer card funding  At December 31, 2014 and 2013, cash restricted are funds held specifically for our card
programs which we have recorded a corresponding customer card funding liability in the same amount. Fixed assets Fixed assets  Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided principally on the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are generally 3 to 10 years. The cost of repairs and maintenance is
charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures for property betterments and renewals are capitalized. Upon sale or other disposition
of a depreciable asset, cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in other
income (expense). The Company periodically
evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that may warrant revision of the estimated useful life of fixed assets
or whether the remaining balance of fixed assets should be evaluated for possible impairment. The Company uses an estimate of
the related undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the fixed assets in measuring their recoverability. Goodwill and intangible assets Goodwill and
intangible assets  Goodwill is the purchase premium after adjusting for the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill
is not amortized but is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis, or when events or circumstances indicate a potential
impairment, at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit, as defined under applicable accounting guidance, is a business segment
or one level below a business segment. We may in any given period bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to a
two-step method to assess and measure impairment of the reporting units goodwill. We first assess qualitative factors to determine
whether it is more likely-than-not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less
than its carrying value. This step serves as the basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative
impairment test. The first step of the quantitative impairment test involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each
reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying
amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired; however, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated
fair value, then the second step of the quantitative impairment test must be performed. The second step compares the implied fair
value of the reporting units goodwill with its carrying amount to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The implied
fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. If the
carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is
recognized in an amount equal to that excess. For intangible
assets, we recognize an impairment loss if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds fair value.
The carrying amount of the intangible asset is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows
expected to result from the use of the asset. Intangible assets
with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Fair value of financial instruments Fair value
of financial instruments  Under applicable accounting guidance, fair value is defined as the exchange price that would
be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the
asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. We determine
the fair values of our financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established under applicable accounting guidance
which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair
value. The following describes the three-level hierarchy: Level 1 
Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and liabilities include debt and
equity securities. Level 2 
Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets
that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the
full term of the assets or liabilities. We currently do not have any assets or liabilities in this category. Level 3 
Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the overall fair value of the
assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments for which the determination of fair value
requires significant management judgment or estimation. The fair value for such assets and liabilities is generally determined
using pricing models, market comparables, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques that incorporate the assumptions
a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. We currently do not have any assets or liabilities in this category. Earnings per share Earnings per
share  Basic earnings per share exclude any dilutive effects of options, warrants and convertible securities. Basic
earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding common stocks during the applicable period. Diluted
earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common and common stock equivalent shares outstanding during
the period. Common stock equivalent shares are excluded from the computation if their effect is antidilutive. Income taxes Income taxes  Our income tax expense is comprised of current and deferred income tax expense. Current income tax expense approximates
taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period. Deferred income tax expense results from the changes in deferred tax assets
and liabilities during the periods. These gross deferred tax assets and liabilities represent decreases or increases in taxes
expected to be paid in the future because of future reversals of temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities
as measured by tax laws and their basis as reported in our consolidated financial statements. We also recognize deferred tax assets
for tax attributes such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. We record valuation allowances to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amounts we conclude are more likely-than-not to be realized in the foreseeable future. We recognize
and measure income tax benefits based upon a two-step model: 1) a tax position must be more likely-than-not to be sustained based
solely on its technical merits in order to be recognized, and 2) the benefit is measured as the largest dollar amount of that
position that is more likely-than-not to be sustained upon settlement. The difference between the benefit recognized for a position
and the tax benefit claimed on a tax return is referred to as an unrecognized tax benefit. We accrue income tax related interest
and penalties, if applicable, within income tax expense. We are in the
process of filing certain consolidated tax returns whereby past subsidiary losses are used to offset tax liabilities on current
profits. This approach could be challenged by the IRS and if not accepted, may affect net income and earnings per share. Management
believes that the likelihood of the IRS not accepting such filings is minimal. Revenue and expense recognition Revenue and
expense recognition  We recognize revenue when (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement existing, (2) delivery
has occurred, (3) our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and (4) collectability of the receivables is reasonably assured.
We recognize the costs of these revenues at the time revenue is recognized. Any fees paid up front are deferred until such time
such services have been considered rendered. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, there are no deferred revenues recorded. We generate the
following types of revenues: Administration
and usage fees, charged to our prepaid card clients when our programs are created, distributed or reloaded. Such revenues are
recognized when such services are performed. Transaction fees,
paid by the applicable networks and passed through by our card issuing banks when our SVCs are used in a purchase or ATM
transaction. Such revenues are recognized when such services are performed. Maintenance,
administration, transaction fees, charged to an SVC and not under any multiple element arrangements. Such revenues are recognized
when such services are performed. Program maintenance
management fees charged to our clients. Such revenues are not under any multiple element arrangements and are recognized when
such services are performed. Software development
and consulting services to our clients. Such revenues are recognized in accordance with FASB ASC 985-605. The Company records
all revenues on gross basis in accordance with FASB ASC 605-45 since it is the primary obligor and establishes the price in the
revenue arrangement. The Company is currently under no obligation for refunding any fees or has any obligations for disputed
claim settlements. Stock-Based Compensation Stock-Based
Compensation  Stock based compensation is accounted for using the Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employee Topic of the
FASB ASC , which establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments
for goods or services. It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services
that are based on the fair value of the entitys equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity
instruments. We determine the value of stock issued at the date of grant. We also determine at the date of grant the value of
stock at fair market value or the value of services rendered (based on contract or otherwise) whichever is more readily determinable. Shares issued
to employees are expensed upon issuance. Stock based compensation
for employees is account for using the Stock Based Compensation Topic of the FASB ASC. We use the fair value method for equity
instruments granted to employees and will use the Black Scholes model for measuring the fair value of options, if issued. The
stock based fair value compensation is determined as of the date of the grant or the date at which the performance of the services
is completed (measurement date) and is recognized over the vesting periods. Advertising costs Advertising
costs  Advertising costs incurred in the normal course of operations are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs Research and
development costs  Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. New accounting pronouncements New accounting
pronouncements  In January 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards
Update ("ASU") No. 2014-04, Receivables - Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors ("ASU 2014-04"),
which intends to clarify when a creditor should be considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate
property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan such that the loan should be derecognized and the real estate recognized. ASU
2014-04 is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2014. We
will adopt this standard effective January 1, 2015. Our adoption of ASU 2014-14 is not expected to have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements. In May 2014,
the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("ASU 2014-09"), which supersedes nearly
all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised
goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled
for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment
and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing GAAP. The standard is effective
for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods therein, using either of the following transition methods:
(i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to
elect certain practical expedients, or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09
recognized at the date of adoption (which includes additional footnote disclosures). We are currently evaluating the impact of
our pending adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements and have not yet determined the method by which we
will adopt the standard in 2017. In August 2014,
the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial StatementsGoing Concern. The provisions of ASU No. 2014-15
require management to assess an entitys ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain
principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial
doubt, (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods, (3) provide principles for considering the
mitigating effect of managements plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result
of consideration of managements plans, (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is
not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued
(or available to be issued). The amendments in this ASU are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and
for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this ASU on the Companys
consolidated financial statements.

Warrants and rights outstanding are derivative securities that give the holder the right to purchase securities (usually equity) from the issuer at a specific price within a certain time frame. Warrants are often included in a new debt issue to entice investors by a higher return potential. The main difference between warrants and call options is that warrants are issued and guaranteed by the company, whereas options are exchange instruments and are not issued by the company. Also, the lifetime of a warrant is often measured in years, while the lifetime of a typical option is measured in months. Disclose the title of issue of securities called for by warrants and rights outstanding, the aggregate amount of securities called for by warrants and rights outstanding, the date from which the warrants or rights are exercisable, and the price at which the warrant or right is exercisable. + References Reference 1: http://www.xbrl.org/2003/role/presentationRef -Publisher FASB -Name Accounting Standards Codification -Topic 235 -SubTopic 10 -Section S99 -Paragraph 1 -Subparagraph (SX 210.4-08.(i)) -URI http://asc.fasb.org/extlink&oid=26873400&loc=d3e23780-122690 Reference 2: http://www.xbrl.org/2003/role/presentationRef -Publisher SEC -Name Regulation S-X (SX) -Number 210 -Section 08 -Paragraph i -Article 4 Reference 3: http://www.xbrl.org/2003/role/presentationRef -Publisher FASB -Name Accounting Standards Codification -Topic 718 -SubTopic 10 -Section 50 -Paragraph 1 -Subparagraph (a) -URI http://asc.fasb.org/extlink&oid=6415400&loc=d3e5047-113901 Reference 4: http://www.xbrl.org/2003/role/presentationRef -Publisher FASB -Name Accounting Standards Codification -Topic 505 -SubTopic 50 -Section 50 -Paragraph 1 -URI http://asc.fasb.org/extlink&oid=6406099&loc=d3e25284-112666 Reference 5: http://www.xbrl.org/2003/role/presentationRef -Publisher FASB -Name Accounting Standards Codification -Topic 505 -SubTopic 50 -Section S99 -Paragraph 1 -URI http://asc.fasb.org/extlink&oid=6784392&loc=d3e188667-122775 Reference 6: http://www.xbrl.org/2003/role/presentationRef -Publisher SEC -Name Regulation S-X (SX) -Number 210 -Section 02 -Paragraph 28 -Article 5 + Details Name: us-gaap_ScheduleOfStockholdersEquityNoteWarrantsOrRightsTextBlock Namespace Prefix: us-gaap_ Data Type: nonnum:textBlockItemType Balance Type: na Period Type: duration
