 Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview We engineer, manufacture and market air conditioning and heating equipment consisting of rooftop units, chillers, packaged outdoor mechanical rooms, air handling units, makeup air units, energy recovery units, condensing units, self-contained units and coils. These products are marketed and sold to retail, manufacturing, educational, lodging, supermarket, medical and other commercial industries. We market our products to all 50 states in the United States and certain provinces in Canada. Our business can be affected by a number of economic factors, including the level of economic activity in the markets in which we operate. The recent uncertainty of the economy has negatively impacted the commercial and industrial new construction markets. A further decline in economic activity could result in a decrease in our sales volume and profitability. Sales in the commercial and industrial new construction markets correlate closely to the number of new homes and buildings that are built, which in turn is influenced by cyclical factors such as interest rates, inflation, consumer spending habits, employment rates and other macroeconomic factors over which we have no control. We sell our products to property owners and contractors through a network of manufacturers’ representatives and our internal sales force. The demand for our products is influenced by national and regional economic and demographic factors. The commercial and industrial new construction market is subject to cyclical fluctuations in that it is generally tied to housing starts, but has a lag factor of six to 18 months. Housing starts, in turn, are affected by such factors as interest rates, the state of the economy, population growth and the relative age of the population. When new construction is down, we emphasize the replacement market. The new construction market in 2014 continued to be unpredictable and uneven. Thus, throughout the year, we emphasized promotion of the benefits of AAON equipment to property owners in the replacement market. The principal components of cost of goods sold are labor, raw materials, component costs, factory overhead, freight and engineering expense. The principal high volume raw materials used in our manufacturing processes are steel, copper and aluminum and are obtained from domestic suppliers. We also purchase from domestic manufacturers certain components, including compressors, motors and electrical controls. The price levels of our raw materials have remained relatively consistent the past few years, but the market continues to be volatile and unpredictable as a result of the uncertainty related to the U.S. economy and a weakening global economy. For the year ended December 31, 2014 , the price for copper decreased approximately 5.1% from a year ago, while the prices for galvanized steel, stainless steel, and aluminum increased 2.2% , 3.4% and 8.6% , respectively, from a year ago. For the year ended December 31, 2013 , prices for copper, galvanized steel, stainless steel, and aluminum decreased approximately 3.4% , 4.2% , 14.1% and 6.8% , respectively, from 2012. In 2011, we began using an all aluminum microchannel condenser coil on our small rooftop unit product line, and in 2013, we began using this condenser coil in our new large rooftop product line as well. The condenser coil is the outdoor coil of a conventional air conditioning system. We expect to be using this type of condenser coil throughout the complete rooftop unit product line. This will reduce our copper tube usage in this component of the product, however, copper will remain a high volume raw material because of its use throughout the equipment. We attempt to limit the impact of price fluctuations on these materials by entering into cancellable and non-cancellable fixed price contracts with our major suppliers for periods of six to 18 months. We expect to receive delivery of raw materials from our fixed price contracts for use in our manufacturing operations. The following are highlights of our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition: • We made $4.2 million in charitable donations in 2014, with $2.9 million of that occurring in the three months ended September 30, 2014. • We paid $16.1 million in capital expenditures in 2014 , a increase of $7.1 million from the $9.0 million in 2013 to increase our production capacity and efficiency. • We paid cash dividends of $9.7 million in 2014 compared to $7.4 million in 2013 . 13 • We reinstated open market repurchases, repurchasing approximately 1.0 million shares for $20.0 million from the open market in the last six months of 2014.

Because of our wide product mix and flexibility of features within each product, overall net sales increased approximately 11.0%. We estimate that approximately 5.5% of the net sales increase was a related to increases in the average sales price due to changes in product mix and price increases and the other 3.9% was related to increased unit sales. Cost of Sales Years Ending December 31, Percent of Sales 2014 2013 2014 2013 (in thousands) Cost of sales $ 248,059 $ 231,348 69.6 % 72.0 % Gross Profit 108,263 89,792 30.4 % 28.0 % The principal components of cost of sales are labor, raw materials, component costs, factory overhead, freight out and engineering expense. The principal high volume raw materials used in our manufacturing processes are steel, copper and aluminum, which are obtained from domestic suppliers. The improvement in gross profit is primarily due to efficiencies gained from our investment in equipment.

These increases were offset by a decrease in warranty expense as a result of improvements in quality control. Income Taxes Years Ending December 31, Effective Tax Rate 2014 2013 2014 2013 (in thousands) Income tax provision $ 24,088 $ 18,747 35.3 % 33.3 % The income tax provision for 2013 reflected benefits related to the R&D Credit and the Indian Employment Credit of approximately $0.9 million for tax years 2013 and 2012. These federal credits were retroactively reinstated on January 2, 2013, with the enactment of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 ("ATRA"). 15 Year Ended December 31, 2013 vs. Year Ended December 31, 2012 Net Sales Years Ending December 31, 2013 2012 $ Change % Change (in thousands, except unit data) Net sales $ 321,140 $ 303,114 $ 18,026 5.9 % Total units 16,666 15,809 857 5.4 % The increase in net sales was the result of the favorable reception to our new products and increased market share, along with 3-4% price increases introduced during the year. Because of our wide product mix and flexibility of features within each product, overall net sales increased approximately 6%. We estimate that approximately 3% of the net sale increase was related to the price increases during the year and the other 3% was related to increased unit sales.

In addition, warranty expenses increased due to higher sales and claims in 2013 compared to 2012. Income Taxes Years Ending December 31, Effective Tax Rate 2013 2012 2013 2012 (in thousands) Income tax provision $ 18,747 $ 16,868 33.3 % 38.1 % The income tax provision for 2013 reflected benefits related to the R&D Credit and the Indian Employment Credit of approximately $0.9 million for tax years 2013 and 2012. These federal credits were retroactively reinstated on January 2, 2013, with the enactment of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 ("ATRA"). No R&D Credit or Indian Employment Credit benefits were recorded in the income tax provision for 2012. The Company also had a change in estimate related to the recoverability of certain 2012 tax credits that was recorded in the first quarter of 2013 for approximately $0.6 million, causing our effective tax rate to be lower than expected. This change in estimate was the result of additional and better information. In addition, our domestic manufacturing deduction for 2013 increased approximately $0.7 million compared to 2012. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our working capital and capital expenditure requirements are generally met through net cash provided by operations and the occasional use of the revolving bank line of credit based on our current liquidity at the time. Our cash and cash equivalents increased $9.9 million from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014 . As of December 31, 2014 , we had $22.0 million in cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2014 , we had certificates of deposit of $11.4 million and investments held to maturity at amortized cost of $16.0 million . These certificates of deposit had maturity dates of less than one month to approximately 19 months . The investments held to maturity at amortized cost had maturity dates of less than one month to approximately 19 months . 17 On July 25, 2014 we renewed the line of credit with BOKF, NA dba Bank of Oklahoma, formerly known as Bank of Oklahoma, N.A. ("Bank of Oklahoma"). The revolving line of credit matures on July 27, 2016. We expect to renew our line of credit in July 2016 with favorable terms as we do not anticipate a tightening of funds in the financial markets. Under the line of credit, there was one standby letter of credit of $0.8 million as of December 31, 2014 . At December 31, 2014 we have $29.2 million of borrowings available under the revolving credit facility. No fees are associated with the unused portion of the committed amount. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , there were no outstanding balances under the revolving credit facility. Interest on borrowings is payable monthly at LIBOR plus 2.5% . The weighted average interest rate was 2.7% for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. At December 31, 2014 , we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the revolving credit facility. We are obligated to comply with certain financial covenants under the revolving credit facility. These covenants require that we meet certain parameters related to our tangible net worth, total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio and working capital. At December 31, 2014 , our tangible net worth was $175.7 million , which meets the requirement of being at or above $95.0 million. Our total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio was 0.3 to 1.0 which meets the requirement of not being above 2 to 1. Our working capital was $88.4 million , which meets the requirement of being at or above $40.0 million. We repurchased shares of stock from the open market, from employees’ 401(k) savings investment plan, option exercises of our directors and officers and vested restricted stock from employees, directors and officers in the amount of $29.3 million for 1.5 million shares, $8.2 million for 0.6 million shares and $6.7 million for 0.8 million shares in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. We repurchased the shares at current market prices. Prior year share amounts have been adjusted for the three-for-two stock split effective July 16, 2014. For the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 we paid cash dividends of $9.7 million , $7.4 million and $8.8 million , respectively. Based on historical performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents balance, the projected cash flows generated from our operations, our existing committed revolving credit facility (or comparable financing) and our expected ability to access capital markets will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations in 2015 and the foreseeable future. 18 Statement of Cash Flows The table below reflects a summary of our net cash flows provided by operating activities, net cash flows used in investing activities, and net cash flows used in financing activities for the years indicated. 2014 2013 2012 (in thousands) Operating Activities Net Income $ 44,158 $ 37,547 $ 27,449 Income statement adjustments, net 10,915 12,892 12,350 Changes in assets and liabilities: Accounts receivable (5,007 ) 4,662 (9,646 ) Income tax receivable (257 ) 464 9,715 Inventories (5,613 ) 231 2,271 Prepaid expenses and other (305 ) 436 (17 ) Accounts payable 3,512 (5,197 ) 2,461 Deferred revenue 782 615 — Accrued liabilities 4,094 1,942 6,584 Net cash provided by operating activities 52,279 53,592 51,167 Investing Activities Capital expenditures (16,127 ) (9,041 ) (14,147 ) Purchases of investments (16,820 ) (31,383 ) (18,194 ) Maturities of investments and proceeds from called investments 26,536 8,937 1,926 Other 382 161 80 Net cash used in investing activities (6,029 ) (31,326 ) (30,335 ) Financing Activities (Payments) borrowings under revolving credit facility, net — — (4,575 ) Stock options exercised and excess tax benefits from stock options exercised and restricted stock awards vested 2,557 2,310 2,389 Repurchase of stock (29,284 ) (8,222 ) (6,660 ) Cash dividends paid to stockholders (9,656 ) (7,428 ) (8,840 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (36,383 ) $ (13,340 ) $ (17,686 ) Cash Flows from Operating Activities Cash flows from operating activities has remained relatively consistent in 2014 with 2013 and 2012. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Capital expenditures increased in 2014 as compared to 2013 and were primarily related to investments in additional land and manufacturing and production equipment to support our growth and improve efficiencies. The Company has purchased two additional Salvagninis for each of its Longview and Tulsa facilities to increase sheet metal production and capacity. The capital expenditure program for 2015 is estimated to be approximately $22.0 million. Many of these projects are subject to review and cancellation at the discretion of our CEO and Board of Directors without incurring substantial charges. Investment purchase activity declined in 2014, with maturities of investments utilized to fund our buyback activity. 19 Cash Flows from Financing Activities We continued to increase our buyback activity in 2014 compared to prior years, to include approximately $20.0 million in open market repurchases in 2014. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are not party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Commitments and Contractual Agreements We had no material contractual purchase agreements as of December 31, 2014 . Contingencies We are subject to various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. We closely monitor these claims and legal actions and frequently consult with our legal counsel to determine whether they may, when resolved, have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows and we accrue and/or disclose loss contingencies as appropriate. We have concluded that the likelihood is remote that the ultimate resolution of any pending litigation or claims will be material or have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses in our consolidated financial statements and related notes. We base our estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and such differences could be material. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates, assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Inventory Reserves – We establish a reserve for inventories based on the change in inventory requirements due to product line changes, the feasibility of using obsolete parts for upgraded part substitutions, the required parts needed for part supply sales, replacement parts and for estimated shrinkage. Warranty – A provision is made for estimated warranty costs at the time the product is shipped and revenue is recognized. The warranty period is: the earlier of one year from the date of first use or 18 months from date of shipment for parts only; an additional four years on compressors (if applicable); 15 years on aluminized steel gas-fired heat exchangers (if applicable); 25 years on stainless steel heat exchangers (if applicable); and 10 years on gas-fired heat exchangers in RL products (if applicable). With the introduction of the RQ product line in 2010, our warranty policy for the RQ series was implemented to cover parts for two years from date of unit shipment and labor for one year from date of unit shipment. Warranty expense is estimated based on the warranty period, historical warranty trends and associated costs, and any known identifiable warranty issue. Due to the absence of warranty history on new products, an additional provision may be made for such products. Our estimated future warranty cost is subject to adjustment from time to time depending on changes in actual warranty trends and cost experience. Should actual claim rates differ from our estimates, revisions to the estimated product warranty liability would be required. 20 Stock Compensation – We measure and recognize compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to our employees and directors, including stock options and restricted stock awards, based on their fair values at the time of grant. Compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis during the service period of the related share-based compensation award. Forfeitures are estimated based on the Company's historical experience. The fair value of each option award and restricted stock award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. The use of the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model requires the input of subjective assumptions such as: the expected volatility, the expected term of the options granted, expected dividend yield, and the risk-free rate. New Accounting Pronouncements Changes to U.S. GAAP are established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") in the form of accounting standards updates ("ASUs") to the FASB's Accounting Standards Codification. We consider the applicability and impact of all ASUs. ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2017. Early application is not permitted. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We do not expect ASU 2014-09 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Item 7A
