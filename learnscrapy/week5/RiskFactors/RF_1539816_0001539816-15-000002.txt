Certain Derivatives Instruments. None. Item 1117. Legal Proceedings. U.S. Bank National Association has provided the following information to the depositor: In June 2014, a civil complaint was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, by a group of institutional investors against U.S. Bank National Association (“U.S. Bank”), in its capacity as trustee or successor trustee (as the case may be) under certain residential mortgage backed securities ("RMBS") trusts. The plaintiffs are investment funds formed by nine investment advisors (AEGON, BlackRock, Brookfield, DZ Bank, Kore, PIMCO, Prudential, Sealink and TIAA) that purport to be bringing suit derivatively on behalf of 841 RMBS trusts that issued $771 billion in original principal amount of securities between 2004 and 2008. According to the plaintiffs, cumulative losses for these RMBS trusts equal $92.4 billion as of the date of the complaint. The complaint is one of six similar complaints filed against RMBS trustees (Deutsche Bank, Citibank, HSBC, Bank of New York Mellon and Wells Fargo) by certain of these plaintiffs. The complaint against U.S. Bank alleges the trustee caused losses to investors as a result of alleged failures by the sponsors, mortgage loan sellers and servicers for these RMBS trusts and asserts causes of action based upon the trustee's purported failure to enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for alleged breaches of representations and warranties concerning loan quality. The complaint also asserts that the trustee failed to notify securityholders of purported events of default allegedly caused by breaches by mortgage loan servicers and that the trustee purportedly failed to abide by appropriate standards of care following events of default. Relief sought includes money damages in an unspecified amount and equitable relief. In November 2014, the plaintiffs sought leave to voluntarily dismiss their original state court complaint and filed a substantially similar complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The federal civil complaint added a class action allegation and a change in the total number of named trusts to 843 RMBS trusts. In December 2014, the plaintiffs’ motion to voluntarily dismiss their original state court complaint was granted. Other cases alleging similar causes of action have previously been filed against U.S. Bank and other trustees by RMBS investors in other transactions. There can be no assurances as to the outcome of the litigation, or the possible impact of the litigation on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. However, U.S. Bank denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions were not the cause of losses to investors and that it has meritorious defenses, and it intends to contest the plaintiffs’ claims vigorously.

Management is responsible for the Company's compliance with the servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assertion about the Company's compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with the applicable servicing criteria, including tests on a sample basis of the servicing activities related to the Securities, determining whether the Company performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria during the specified period, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our procedures were limited to selected servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report and, accordingly, such samples may not have included servicing activities related to each asset-backed transaction included in the Securities. Further, an examination is not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to the period specified above that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company's compliance with the servicing criteria. In our opinion, management's assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014 for the Senior Secured Transition Bonds is fairly stated, in all material respects. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP March 27, 2015 Columbus, Ohio EX-34.2 6 tcctfiii10kexhibit342.htm EXHIBIT 34.2 TCC TF III 10K Exhibit 34.2 EXHIBIT 34.2 Attestation report on assessment of compliance with servicing criteria for asset-backed securities of ERNST & YOUNG LLP on behalf of U.S. Bank National Association, as Indenture Trustee Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors U.S. Bank National Association We have examined management’s assertion, included in the accompanying Report on Assessment for Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, that U.S. Bank National Association (the “Company”) complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Regulation AB for the U.S. Bank Corporate Trust Asset-Backed Securities Platform (the “Platform”), for which the Company provides trustee, registrar, paying agent, and securities administrator services, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014, except for servicing criteria 1122 (d)(1)(iii), 1122 (d)(4)(i)-(ii), and 1122 (d)(4)(iv)-(xiv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities performed by them with respect to the servicing platform covered by this report. Management is responsible for the Company’s compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assertion about the Company’s compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company’s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all of the individual asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. Although the Company is responsible for assessing compliance with Items 1122 (d)(1)(ii) and 1122 (d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB, there were no servicing activities performed by the Company during the period from January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014, that required these servicing criteria to be complied with. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company’s compliance with the servicing criteria. In our opinion, management’s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014, for the U.S. Bank Corporate Trust Asset-Backed Securities Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects. /s/ Ernst & Young Minneapolis, Minnesota February 27, 2015 EX-35.1 7 tcctfiii10kexhibit351.htm EXHIBIT 35.1 TCC TF III 10K Exhibit 35.1 EXHIBIT 35.1 SERVICER COMPLIANCE STATEMENT I, Julia A.
