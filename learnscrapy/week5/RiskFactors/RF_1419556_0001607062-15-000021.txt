STATEMENTS Certain
statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are “forward-looking statements” (within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations. Such statements
involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements of
AFH ACQUISITION IX, Inc. (the “Company”) to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements
expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included herein are based on current expectations
that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. The Company's plans and objectives are based, in part, on assumptions involving
the continued expansion of business. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things,
future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to
predict accurately and many of which are beyond the control of the Company. Although the Company believes its assumptions underlying
the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance
the forward-looking statements included in this Report will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent
in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation
by the Company or any other person that the objectives and plans of the Company will be achieved. 2 PART
I Item 1. Description of Business. AFH
Acquisition IX, Inc. (“we”, “us”, “our”, the "Company") was incorporated under the
laws of the State of Delaware on October 18, 2007. Since inception, the Company has been engaged in organizational efforts and
obtaining initial financing. The Company was formed as a vehicle to pursue a business combination and has made no efforts to identify
a possible business combination. As a result, the Company has not conducted negotiations or entered into a letter of intent concerning
any target business. The business purpose of the Company is to seek the acquisition of, or merger with, an existing company. The
Company selected October 31 as its fiscal year end. The
Company, based on proposed business activities, is a "blank check" company. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(the “SEC”) defines those companies as "any development stage company that is issuing a penny stock, within the
meaning of Section 3 (a)(51) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and that has
no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies."
Under SEC Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, the Company also qualifies as a “shell company,” because it has no or
nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations. Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting
the sale of securities of "blank check" companies in their respective jurisdictions. Management does not intend to undertake
any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity, until we have successfully concluded a business
combination. The Company intends to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as it is subject
to those requirements. The
Company was organized as a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking
the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. The Company’s principal business objective for the next 12
months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate,
short-term earnings. The Company will not restrict its potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry
or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business. The
analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of Amir Farrokh Heshmatpour, the sole officer
and director of the Company. As of this date the Company has not entered into any definitive agreement with any party, nor have
there been any specific discussions with any potential business combination candidate regarding business opportunities for the
Company. The Company has unrestricted flexibility in seeking, analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities.
In its efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets, the Company will consider the following kinds of factors: (a)
Potential for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products; (b)
Competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the
industry as a whole; (c)
Strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment; (d)
Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by the Company or from operations, through
the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources; (e)
The cost of participation by the Company as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potentials; (f)
The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced; (g)
The accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance and other required
items; and (h)
Other relevant factors. 3 In
applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances
and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available business opportunities
may occur in many different industries, and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation
and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Due to the Company's limited capital available for
investigation, the Company may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired. FORM
OF ACQUISITION The
manner in which the Company participates in an opportunity will depend upon the nature of the opportunity, the respective needs
and desires of the Company and the promoters of the opportunity, and the relative negotiating strength of the Company and such
promoters. It
is likely that the Company will acquire its participation in a business opportunity through the issuance of common stock or other
securities of the Company. Although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted, it should be noted that in certain
circumstances the criteria for determining whether or not an acquisition is a so-called "tax free" reorganization under
Section 368(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") depends upon whether the owners of the
acquired business own 80% or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity. If a transaction were structured to take advantage
of these provisions rather than other "tax free" provisions provided under the Code, all prior stockholders would in
such circumstances retain 20% or less of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. Under other circumstances,
depending upon the relative negotiating strength of the parties, prior stockholders may retain substantially less than 20% of
the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. This could result in substantial additional dilution to the equity
of those who were stockholders of the Company prior to such reorganization. The
sole stockholder of the Company will likely not have control of a majority of the voting securities of the Company following a
reorganization transaction. As part of such a transaction, the Company's sole director may resign and one or more new directors
may be appointed without any vote by stockholders. In
the case of an acquisition, the transaction may be accomplished upon the sole determination of management without any vote or
approval by stockholders. In the case of a statutory merger or consolidation directly involving the Company, it will likely be
necessary to call a stockholders' meeting and obtain the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding securities.
The necessity to obtain such stockholder approval may result in delay and additional expense in the consummation of any proposed
transaction and will also give rise to certain appraisal rights to dissenting stockholders. Most likely, management will seek
to structure any such transaction so as not to require stockholder approval. It
is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant
agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial
cost for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs
incurred in the related investigation might not be recoverable. Furthermore,
even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction
may result in the loss to the Company of the related costs incurred. We
presently have no employees apart from our management. Our sole officer and director is engaged in outside business activities
and anticipate that he will devote to our business very limited time until the acquisition of a successful business opportunity
has been identified. We expect no significant changes in the number of our employees other than such changes, if any, incident
to a business combination. Item 1A. Risk Factors. As
a “smaller reporting company” as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide this
information. 4 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. As
a “smaller reporting company” as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide this
information. Item 2. Description of Property. The
Company neither rents nor owns any properties. The Company utilizes the office space and equipment of its management at no cost.
Management estimates such amounts to be immaterial. The Company currently has no policy with respect to investments or interests
in real estate, real estate mortgages or securities of, or interests in, persons primarily engaged in real estate activities. Item 3. Legal Proceedings. To
the best knowledge of our sole officer and director, the Company is not a party to any legal proceeding or litigation. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not
Applicable. PART
II Item 5. Market for Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Small Business Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. Common
Stock Our
Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share (the
“Common Stock”). The Common Stock is not listed on a publicly-traded market. As of January 29, 2015, there was one
holder of record of the Common Stock. Preferred
Stock Our
Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.001 per share
(the “Preferred Stock”). The Company has not yet issued any of its Preferred Stock. Dividend
Policy The
Company has not declared or paid any cash dividends on its Common Stock and does not intend to declare or pay any cash dividend
in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends, if any, is within the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend
on the Company’s earnings, if any, its capital requirements and financial condition and such other factors as the Board
of Directors may consider. Securities
Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans The
Company does not have any equity compensation plans or any individual compensation arrangements with respect to its Common Stock
or Preferred Stock. The issuance of any of our common or preferred stock is within the discretion of our Board of Directors, which
has the power to issue any or all of our authorized but unissued shares without stockholder approval. Recent
Sales of Unregistered Securities There
were no unregistered sales of equity securities during the year ended October 31, 2014. Issuer
Purchases of Equity Securities None. 5 Item 6. Selected Financial Data. As
a “smaller reporting company” as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide this
information. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. The
Company currently does not engage in any business activities that provide cash flow. During the next twelve months we anticipate
incurring costs related to: (i)
filing Exchange Act reports, and (ii)
investigating, analyzing and consummating an acquisition. We
believe we will be able to meet these costs through use of funds in our treasury, through deferral of fees by certain service
providers and additional amounts, as necessary, to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders, management or other investors. The
Company may consider acquiring a business which has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in need of additional
funds for expansion into new products or markets, is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is an established business
which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. In the alternative, a business
combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which
desires to establish a public trading market for its shares while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense,
and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering. Any
target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth,
including entities without established records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous risks inherent
in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, we
may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, and, although our management
will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there can be no assurance that we will properly
ascertain or assess all significant risks. The
Company anticipates that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky. Because of general economic
conditions, rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, our management believes
that there are numerous firms seeking even the limited additional capital which we will have and/or the perceived benefits of
becoming a publicly traded corporation. Such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other
things, facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the
principals of and investors in a business, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees,
and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock. Potentially
available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will
make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Liquidity
and Capital Resources As
of October 31, 2014, the Company had assets equal to $-0-. This compares with assets of $-0- , comprised of cash and cash
equivalents, as of October 31, 2013. The Company’s current liabilities as of October 31, 2014 totaled $42,816, comprised
of accrued expenses and monies due to parent. This compares with liabilities of $36,465, comprised of accrued expenses
and monies due to parent, as of October 31, 2013. The Company can provide no assurance that it can continue to satisfy
its cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. 6 The
following is a summary of the Company's cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the
years ended October 31, 2014, and 2013. Fiscal Year Ended October 31, 2014 Fiscal Year Ended October 31, 2013 Net Cash (Used in) Operating Activities $ (5,957 ) $ (5,994 ) Net Cash (Used in) Investing Activities - - Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities $ (5,957 ) $ 5,994 ) Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents $ - $ - The
Company has nominal assets and has generated no revenues since inception. The Company is also dependent upon the receipt of capital
investment or other financing to fund its ongoing operations and to execute its business plan of seeking a combination with a
private operating company. In addition, the Company is dependent upon certain related parties to provide continued funding and
capital resources. If continued funding and capital resources are unavailable at reasonable terms, the Company may not be able
to implement its plan of operations. Results
of Operations The
Company has not conducted any active operations since inception, except for its efforts to locate suitable acquisition candidates.
No revenue has been generated by the Company from October 18, 2007 (Inception) to October 31, 2014. It is unlikely the Company
will have any revenues unless it is able to effect an acquisition or merger with an operating company, of which there can be no
assurance. It is management's assertion that these circumstances may hinder the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
The Company’s plan of operation for the next twelve months shall be to continue its efforts to locate suitable acquisition
candidates. For
the fiscal year ended October 31, 2014, the Company had a net loss of $6.351, consisting of legal, accounting, audit, other professional
service fees and expenses incurred in relation to the filing of the Company’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Annual
Report on Form 10-K. For
the fiscal year ended October 31, 2013, the Company had a net loss of $5,086, consisting of legal, accounting, audit, other professional
service fees and expenses incurred in relation to the filing of the Company’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Annual
Report on Form 10-K. Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements The
Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect
on the Company’s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. Contractual
Obligations As
a “smaller reporting company” as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide this
information. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. As
a “smaller reporting company” as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide this
information. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. None 7 Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The
Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported,
within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without
limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that
it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal
executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In
accordance with Exchange Act Rules 13a-15, an evaluation was completed under the supervision and with the participation of the
Company’s management, including the Company’s President, Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer,
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the
period covered by this Annual Report. Based on that evaluation, the Company’s President, Principal Executive Officer and
Principal Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing
reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange
Act was recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms. Evaluation
of Internal Controls over Financial Reporting The
management of AFH Acquisition IX, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. These
internal controls include policies and procedures that: ● Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets; ● Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; ● Provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of our management and directors; and ● Provide reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that would have a material impact on financial statements will be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement
of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. Management
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control
— Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this
evaluation, management concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of October 31, 2014. 8 This
annual report does not include a report from the Company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting due to the permanent exemption established by the Securities and Exchange Commission for public companies
designated as small filers. Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting There
have been no significant changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended October
31, 2014 that have materially affected, or are reasonable likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial
reporting. Item 9B. Other Information. None. PART
III Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers, Promoters and Control Persons; Compliance With Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act. (a)
Identification of Directors and Executive Officers. The following table sets forth certain information regarding the Company’s
directors and executive officers: Name Age Position Amir F. Heshmatpour 48 President, Secretary, Chief Financial Officer and Director The
Company’s officers and directors are elected annually for a one year term or until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified or until their earlier resignation or removal. Amir
Farrokh Heshmatpour has served as the Company’s President, Secretary and sole director since inception. Mr. Heshmatpour
has been the Managing Director of AFH Holding & Advisory LLC from July 2003 to the present. Prior to that, he took some time
off. From 1996 through January 2002, Mr. Heshmatpour served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Metrophone Telecommunications,

Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings. 9 Litigation
with AFH Advisory and Amir F. Heshmatpour Emmaus
Life Sciences, Inc. AFH
Advisory is presently a plaintiff and a counterclaim defendant in a matter that is pending in both Delaware Superior Court (Index
No. N12C-09-045-MMJ [CCLD]) and Delaware Chancery Court (Index No. C.A. No. 8005-JJ). AFH Advisory brought the suit against Emmaus
Life Sciences, Inc. ("Emmaus") in regards to Emmaus' attempt to cancel AFH Advisory's ownership interest in Emmaus,
and its refusal to reimburse AFH Advisory for expenses relating to a reverse merger. Emmaus has brought counterclaims against
AFH Advisory for a declaratory judgment canceling AFH Advisory's ownership interest in Emmaus, fraud, breach of contract, and
unjust enrichment. All parties completed document discovery and filed motions for summary judgment. Emmaus' motion for partial
summary judgment was granted by the Court, which held that the Third Letter of Intent ("LOI III") between AFH Advisory
and Emmaus was terminated, the public offering contemplated by LOI III was terminated, the advisor shares Emmaus gave to AFH Advisory
and its affiliates pursuant to the terms of LOI III had been canceled, and that AFH and its affiliated must return all Emmaus
shares in their possession. The partial summary judgment motion brought by individual counterclaim defendant Amir Heshmatpour,
and joined in by AFH Advisory, was granted in part by the Court, which held that Emmaus was not entitled to compensatory damages
on its fraud and fraud in the inducement claims. Following the Court's decision on these summary judgment motions, AFH Advisory
does not have any remaining claims against Emmaus. Emmaus continues to maintain claims against AFH Advisory for breach of contract,
fraud, and unjust enrichment. AFH Advisory has asserted defenses for these remaining claims, and it is defending this matter. Emerald
Dairy, Inc. AFH
Advisory and other entities brought a lawsuit in the Superior Court of California, Los Angeles County against Emerald Dairy, Inc.
(“Emerald”) and its Chairman, Mr. Shang, asserting that they were entitled to a large number of shares of Emerald,
both from Emerald and from shares individually owned, and pledged, by Chairman Shang. Emerald and Chairman Shang defaulted. There
were some efforts to enforce the judgment against the Chairman in China, where he resides, but we are not aware of the status
of those efforts. Banner
Bank Judgment Mr.
Amir Heshmatpour is a defendant in two lawsuits related to Banner Bank which have been reduced to judgment. The
lawsuits arise from three loans issued in the late 1990’s. The lender was Town Bank, a Washington State Bank which is no
longer in existence, having been acquired by Banner Bank in the early 2000’s. The borrowers on the three separate loans
were H&H Holdings, Metrophone Telecom, and Amir Heshmatpour. In the early 2000’s, the three loans were consolidated
into one loan, shortly before Banner Bank acquired Town Bank. Once this acquisition occurred, the relationship between the borrowers
and the successor lender soured, and a default was ultimately declared on the loans. Judgments were entered in the Superior Court
for the State of Washington in 2003 and in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington. Mr.
Heshmatpour contends that negotiated agreements were reached for payment of the outstanding loan balance, resulting in an agreement
to pay approximately $11,000,000. Mr. Heshmatpour further contends that the agreements were satisfied, but that Banner Bank failed
to properly account for the payments received. Since the early 2000’s, Banner Bank has retained judgment creditor status
against Mr. Heshmatpour and his wife, and has added interest to the Superior Court judgment in the amount of approximately 12%
per year and to the District Court action in the amount of approximately 6.875% per year. However, for almost the entire decade,
no further collection actions were taken and Mr. Heshmatpour believed the matter was resolved. The
two judgments have recently been domesticated in the United States District Court for the Central District of California and the
California Superior Court. Banner Bank is seeking to enforce the judgments, and Mr. and Mrs. Heshmatpour, who are unaware of the
reasons behind the renewed activity, have retained counsel to defend them in the enforcement proceedings. In
the District Court action, the Court on June 24, 2013 issued an Order charging the ownership interest in AFH Advisory of Amir
Heshmatpour with payment of the unpaid balance in that case of approximately $711,899 and ordering AFH Advisory to pay any distributions
due to Amir Heshmatpour directly to Banner Bank. In the Superior Court action, Amir Heshmatpour filed a motion to vacate and/or
reduce sister state judgment in the amount of approximately $22,873,956.63 which is set for hearing on June 17, 2014. The Superior
Court action is otherwise stayed pending the hearing on June 17, 2014. 10 Compliance
with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company’s directors and officers, and persons who beneficially own more than 10%
of a registered class of the Company’s equity securities, to file reports of beneficial ownership and changes in beneficial
ownership of the Company’s securities with the SEC on Forms 3, 4 and 5. Officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders
are required by SEC regulation to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based
solely on the Company’s review of the copies of the forms received by it during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2014,
and written representations that no other reports were required, the Company believes that no person who, at any time during such
fiscal year, was a director, officer or beneficial owner of more than 10% of the Company’s common stock failed to comply
with all Section 16(a) filing requirements during such fiscal years. Code

OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors
and Stockholders of AFH Acquisition IX We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of AFH Acquisition IX, Inc. as of October 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related statements
of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two year period ended October 31, 2014. . AFH
Acquisition IX’s management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of AFH
Acquisition IX as of October 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the
two year period ended October 31, 2014 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in
Note 4 to the financial statements, the Company has had no revenues and income since inception. These conditions, among others,
raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans concerning these
matters are also described in Note D, which includes the raising of additional equity financing or merger with another entity.
The financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. /s/ Anton & Chia, LLP Anton & Chia, LLP Newport Beach, CA January 29, 2015 F- 1 AFH ACQUISITION IX, INC.

1 -	The Company AFH
Acquisition IX, Inc., a development stage company (the “Company”), was incorporated under the laws of the State of
Delaware on October 18, 2007. The Company is 100% owned by AFH Holding & Advisory, LLC (the “Parent”). The financial
statements presented represent only those transactions of AFH Acquisition IX, Inc. The Company is looking to acquire an existing
company or acquire the technology to begin operations. As
a blank check company, the Company’s business is to pursue a business combination through acquisition, or merger with,
an existing company. As of the date of the financial statements, the Company is not conducting negotiations with any target business.
No assurances can be given that the Company will be successful in locating or negotiating with any target company. Since
inception, the Company has been engaged in organizational efforts. Note
2 -	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Method
of Accounting The
Company maintains its books and prepares its financial statements on the accrual basis of accounting. Cash
and Cash Equivalents Cash
and cash equivalents include time deposits, certificates of deposit, and all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities
of three months or less. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions, which periodically may exceed
federally insured amounts. Loss
per Common Share Loss
per common share is computed in accordance with FASB ASC 260-10, by dividing income (loss) available to common stockholders by
weighted average number of common shares outstanding for each period. Use
of Estimates The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results can differ from those estimates. Organizational
Costs Organizational
costs represent management, consulting, legal, accounting, and filing fees incurred to date in the formation of the company. Organizational
costs are expensed as incurred in accordance with FASB ASC 720-15. Income
Taxes The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC 740-10, using the asset and liability approach, which requires recognition
of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts and the tax basis of such assets and liabilities. This method utilizes enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year
in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse and gives immediate effect to changes in income tax rates upon enactment.
Deferred tax assets are recognized, net of any valuation allowance, for temporary differences and net operating loss and tax credit
carry forwards. Deferred income tax expense represents the change in net deferred assets and liability balances. F-6 Financial
Instruments The
Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and due to parent. Unless otherwise noted, it is management’s opinion
that the Company is not exposed to significant interest, currency or credit risks arising from these financial instruments. The
fair value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying value, unless otherwise noted. Recent
Pronouncements On
June 10, 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915). The amendments in this update remove the definition
of a development stage entity from Topic 915, thereby removing the distinction between development stage entities and other reporting
entities from U.S. GAAP. In addition, the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present
inception-to-date information on the statements of income, cash flows, and shareholder’s equity, (2) label the financial
statements as those of a development stage entity, (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the
entity is engaged, and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior
years it had been in the development stage. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this accounting standard during the
current period. In
May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)," which is the new comprehensive
revenue recognition standard that will supersede all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. The standard's core principle
is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects
the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU is effective for
annual and interim periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is not permitted. Entities will have the
option of using either a full retrospective approach or a modified approach to adopt the guidance in the ASU. The Company currently
has no revenues and doesn’t expect any impact of adopting this guidance. In
June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments
When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period." This
ASU provides more explicit guidance for treating share-based payment awards that require a specific performance target that affects
vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period as a performance condition. The new guidance is effective
for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance
to have a material impact on the financial statements. August
2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, “Presentation of Financial Statements – Going Concern (Topic 205-40)”, which
requires management to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern
for each annual and interim reporting period. If substantial doubt exists, additional disclosure is required. This new standard
will be effective for the Company for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted.
The Company is evaluating the adoption of this accounting standard to determine what material impacts it may have on the financial
statements and related disclosures. F-7 Note

4 -	Going Concern The
Company’s financial statements have been presented on the basis that it is a going concern, which contemplates the realization
of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has reported recurring losses
from operations. As a result, there is an accumulated deficit of $67,816 at October 31, 2014. The
Company’s continued existence is dependent upon its ability to raise capital or acquire a marketable company. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Note

2 -	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Method of Accounting The Company maintains its
books and prepares its financial statements on the accrual basis of accounting. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents
include time deposits, certificates of deposit, and all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months
or less. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions, which periodically may exceed federally insured
amounts. Loss per Common Share Loss per common share is computed
in accordance with FASB ASC 260-10, by dividing income (loss) available to common stockholders by weighted average number of common
shares outstanding for each period. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results can differ from those
estimates. Organizational
Costs Organizational costs represent
management, consulting, legal, accounting, and filing fees incurred to date in the formation of the company. Organizational costs
are expensed as incurred in accordance with FASB ASC 720-15. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income
taxes in accordance with FASB ASC 740-10, using the asset and liability approach, which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities
and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of
such assets and liabilities. This method utilizes enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences
are expected to reverse and gives immediate effect to changes in income tax rates upon enactment. Deferred tax assets are recognized,
net of any valuation allowance, for temporary differences and net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred income
tax expense represents the change in net deferred assets and liability balances. Financial Instruments The Companys financial
instruments consist of cash and due to parent. Unless otherwise noted, it is managements opinion that the Company is not
exposed to significant interest, currency or credit risks arising from these financial instruments. The fair value of these financial
instruments approximates their carrying value, unless otherwise noted. Recent Pronouncements On June 10, 2014,
the FASB issued ASU 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915). The amendments in this update remove the definition of a development
stage entity from Topic 915, thereby removing the distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from
U.S. GAAP. In addition, the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date
information on the statements of income, cash flows, and shareholders equity, (2) label the financial statements as those
of a development stage entity, (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged, and
(4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the
development stage. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this accounting standard during the current period. In May 2014, the FASB
issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)," which is the new comprehensive revenue recognition
standard that will supersede all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. The standard's core principle is that a company
will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU is effective for annual and interim
periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is not permitted. Entities will have the option of using either
a full retrospective approach or a modified approach to adopt the guidance in the ASU. The Company currently has no revenues and
doesnt expect any impact of adopting this guidance. In June 2014, the
FASB issued ASU 2014-12, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms
of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period." This ASU provides more
explicit guidance for treating share-based payment awards that require a specific performance target that affects vesting and that
could be achieved after the requisite service period as a performance condition. The new guidance is effective for annual and interim
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material
impact on the financial statements. August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,
Presentation of Financial Statements  Going Concern (Topic 205-40), which requires management to evaluate
whether there is substantial doubt about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern for each annual and interim reporting
period. If substantial doubt exists, additional disclosure is required. This new standard will be effective for the Company for
annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the adoption
of this accounting standard to determine what material impacts it may have on the financial statements and related disclosures.

affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results can differ from those
estimates. Organizational Costs Organizational
Costs Organizational costs represent
management, consulting, legal, accounting, and filing fees incurred to date in the formation of the company. Organizational costs
are expensed as incurred in accordance with FASB ASC 720-15. Income Taxes Income Taxes The Company accounts for income
taxes in accordance with FASB ASC 740-10, using the asset and liability approach, which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities
and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of
such assets and liabilities. This method utilizes enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences
are expected to reverse and gives immediate effect to changes in income tax rates upon enactment. Deferred tax assets are recognized,
net of any valuation allowance, for temporary differences and net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred income
tax expense represents the change in net deferred assets and liability balances. Financial Instruments Financial Instruments The Companys financial
instruments consist of cash and due to parent. Unless otherwise noted, it is managements opinion that the Company is not
exposed to significant interest, currency or credit risks arising from these financial instruments. The fair value of these financial
instruments approximates their carrying value, unless otherwise noted. Recent Pronouncements Recent Pronouncements On June 10, 2014,
the FASB issued ASU 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915). The amendments in this update remove the definition of a development
stage entity from Topic 915, thereby removing the distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from
U.S. GAAP. In addition, the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date
information on the statements of income, cash flows, and shareholders equity, (2) label the financial statements as those
of a development stage entity, (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged, and
(4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the
development stage. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this accounting standard during the current period. In May 2014, the FASB
issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)," which is the new comprehensive revenue recognition
standard that will supersede all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. The standard's core principle is that a company
will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU is effective for annual and interim
periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is not permitted. Entities will have the option of using either
a full retrospective approach or a modified approach to adopt the guidance in the ASU. The Company currently has no revenues and
doesnt expect any impact of adopting this guidance. In June 2014, the
FASB issued ASU 2014-12, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms
of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period." This ASU provides more
explicit guidance for treating share-based payment awards that require a specific performance target that affects vesting and that
could be achieved after the requisite service period as a performance condition. The new guidance is effective for annual and interim
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material
impact on the financial statements. August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,
Presentation of Financial Statements  Going Concern (Topic 205-40), which requires management to evaluate
whether there is substantial doubt about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern for each annual and interim reporting
period. If substantial doubt exists, additional disclosure is required. This new standard will be effective for the Company for
annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the adoption
of this accounting standard to determine what material impacts it may have on the financial statements and related disclosures.

statements have been presented on the basis that it is a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has reported recurring losses from operations. As a result, there
is an accumulated deficit of $67,816 at October 31, 2014. The Companys continued
existence is dependent upon its ability to raise capital or acquire a marketable company. The financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. X - Details Name: AFHACQIX_GoingConcernAbstract Namespace Prefix: AFHACQIX_ Data Type: xbrli:stringItemType Balance Type: na Period Type: duration X - Definition Disclosure of accounting policy for reporting when there is a substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time (generally a year from the balance sheet date). Disclose: (a) pertinent conditions and events giving rise to the assessment of substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time, (b) the possible effects of such conditions and events, (c) management's evaluation of the significance of those conditions and events and any mitigating factors, (d) possible discontinuance of operations, (e) management's plans (including relevant prospective financial information), and (f) information about the recoverability or classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts or classification of liabilities. If management's plans alleviate the substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosure of the principal conditions and events that initially raised the substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern would be expected to be considered. Disclose whether operations for the current or prior years generated sufficient cash to cover current obligations, whether waivers were obtained from creditors relating to the company's default under the provisions of debt agreements and possible effects of such conditions and events, such as: whether there is a possible need to obtain additional financing (debt or equity) or to liquidate certain holdings to offset future cash flow deficiencies. Disclose appropriate parent company information when parent is dependent upon remittances from subsidiaries to satisfy its obligations. + References No definition available. + Details Name: us-gaap_LiquidityDisclosureTextBlock Namespace Prefix: us-gaap_ Data Type: nonnum:textBlockItemType Balance Type: na Period Type: duration XML 30 FilingSummary.xml IDEA: XBRL DOCUMENT 2.4.1.9 Html 22 65 1 false 3 0 false 4 false false R1.htm 00000001 - Document - Document and Entity Information Sheet http://AFHACQIX/role/DocumentAndEntityInformation Document and Entity Information true false R2.htm 00000002 - Statement - Balance Sheets Sheet http://AFHACQIX/role/BalanceSheets Balance Sheets false false R3.htm 00000003 - Statement - Balance Sheets (Parenthetical) Sheet http://AFHACQIX/role/BalanceSheetsParenthetical Balance Sheets (Parenthetical) false false R4.htm 00000004 - Statement - Statement of Operations Sheet http://AFHACQIX/role/StatementOfOperations Statement of Operations false false R5.htm 00000005 - Statement - Statements of Changes in Stockholders' Deficit Sheet http://AFHACQIX/role/StatementsOfChangesInStockholdersDeficit Statements of Changes in Stockholders' Deficit false false R6.htm 00000006 - Statement - Statement of Cash Flows Sheet http://AFHACQIX/role/StatementOfCashFlows Statement of Cash Flows false false R7.htm 00000007 - Disclosure - The Company Sheet http://AFHACQIX/role/Company The Company false false R8.htm 00000008 - Disclosure - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Sheet http://AFHACQIX/role/SummaryOfSignificantAccountingPolicies Summary of Significant Accounting Policies false false R9.htm 00000009 - Disclosure - Equity Securities Sheet http://AFHACQIX/role/EquitySecurities Equity Securities false false R10.htm 00000010 - Disclosure - Going Concern Sheet http://AFHACQIX/role/GoingConcern Going Concern false false R11.htm 00000011 - Disclosure - Due to Parent Sheet http://AFHACQIX/role/DueToParent Due to Parent false false R12.htm 00000012 - Disclosure - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Policies) Sheet http://AFHACQIX/role/SummaryOfSignificantAccountingPoliciesPolicies Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Policies) false false R13.htm 00000013 - Disclosure - The Company (Details Narrative) Sheet http://AFHACQIX/role/CompanyDetailsNarrative The Company (Details Narrative) false false R14.htm 00000014 - Disclosure - Going Concern (Details Narrative) Sheet http://AFHACQIX/role/GoingConcernDetailsNarrative Going Concern (Details Narrative) false false All Reports Book All Reports Process Flow-Through: 00000002 - Statement - Balance Sheets Process Flow-Through: Removing column 'Oct. 31, 2012' Process Flow-Through: 00000003 - Statement - Balance Sheets (Parenthetical) Process Flow-Through: 00000004 - Statement - Statement of Operations Process Flow-Through: 00000006 - Statement - Statement of Cash Flows afhacqix-20141031.xml afhacqix-20141031.xsd afhacqix-20141031_cal.xml afhacqix-20141031_def.xml afhacqix-20141031_lab.xml afhacqix-20141031_pre.xml true true
