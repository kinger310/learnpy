. IN ADDITION TO THE
OTHER INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THIS REPORT, YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING FACTORS IN EVALUATING OUR BUSINESS, OPERATIONS
AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. ADDITIONAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN TO US, THAT WE CURRENTLY DEEM IMMATERIAL OR THAT
ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE FACED BY OTHER COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY OR BUSINESS IN GENERAL, SUCH AS COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS, MAY ALSO
IMPAIR OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS,
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE HAVE NO RECENT OPERATING HISTORY OR
BASIS FOR EVALUATING PROSPECTS. Since September 30, 2005, we have no operating
business or plans to develop one. We are currently seeking to enter into a merger or business combination with another company.
To date, our efforts have been limited to meeting our regulatory filing requirements and searching for a merger target. We
Have Limited Resources and No Revenues From Operations, and WILL Need Additional Financing in Order to Execute ANY Business Plan. We have limited resources, no revenues
from operations to date and our cash on hand may not be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements during the next twelve months.
In addition, we will not achieve any revenues (other than insignificant investment income) until, at the earliest, the consummation
of a merger and we cannot ascertain our capital requirements until such time. Further limiting our abilities to achieve revenues,
in order to avoid status as an "Investment Company" under the Investment Company Act, we can only invest our funds prior
to a merger in limited investments which do not invoke Investment Company status. There can be no assurance that determinations
ultimately made by us will permit us to achieve our business objectives. 7 We
Will Be Able to Effect At Most One Merger, and Thus May Not Have a Diversified Business. Our resources are limited and we will most
likely have the ability to effect only a single merger. This probable lack of diversification will subject us to numerous economic,
competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a material adverse impact upon the particular industry in
which we may operate subsequent to the consummation of a merger. We will become dependent upon the development or market acceptance
of a single or limited number of products, processes or services. We
Depend SUBSTANTIALLY upon OUR PRESIDENT, Whose Experience Is Limited, to Make All Management Decisions. Our ability to effect a merger will be
dependent upon the efforts of our president, Arnold Kling. Notwithstanding the importance of Mr. Kling, we have not entered into
any employment agreement or other understanding with Mr. Kling concerning compensation or obtained any "key man" life
insurance on any of his life. The loss of the services of Mr. Kling will have a material adverse effect on our business objectives
and success. We rely upon the expertise of Mr. Kling and do not anticipate that we will hire additional personnel. THERE MAY BE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST BETWEEN
OUR MANAGEMENT AND OUR NON-MANAGEMENT STOCKHOLDERS. Conflicts of interest create the risk that
management may have an incentive to act adversely to the interests of other investors. Our officers may be entitled to receive
compensation from a target company they identify or provide services to in connection with a business combination. A conflict of
interest may arise between our management’s personal pecuniary interest and their fiduciary duty to our stockholders. Further,
our management’s own pecuniary interest may at some point compromise their fiduciary duty to our stockholders. In addition,
Messrs. Kling and Warshaw, our officers and directors, are currently involved with other blank check offerings and conflicts in
the pursuit of business combinations with such other blank check companies with which they are, and may in the future be affiliated
with, may arise. If we and the other blank check companies that our officers and directors are affiliated with desire to take advantage
of the same opportunity, then those officers and directors that are affiliated with both companies would abstain from voting upon
the opportunity. We cannot assure you that conflicts of interest among us, our management and our stockholders will not develop. THERE IS COMPETITION FOR THOSE PRIVATE
COMPANIES SUITABLE FOR A MERGER TRANSACTION OF THE TYPE CONTEMPLATED BY MANAGEMENT. We are in a highly competitive market for
a small number of business opportunities which could reduce the likelihood of consummating a successful business combination. We
are and will continue to be an insignificant participant in the business of seeking mergers with, joint ventures with and acquisitions
of small private and public entities. A large number of established and well-financed entities, including small public companies
and venture capital firms, are active in mergers and acquisitions of companies that may be desirable target candidates for us.
Nearly all these entities have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities than
we do; consequently, we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing
a business combination. These competitive factors may reduce the likelihood of our identifying and consummating a successful business
combination. FUTURE SUCCESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE
ABILITY OF MANAGEMENT TO LOCATE AND ATTRACT A SUITABLE ACQUISITION. The nature of our operations is highly
speculative. The success of our plan of operation will depend to a great extent on the operations, financial condition and management
of the identified business opportunity. While management intends to seek business combination(s) with entities having established
operating histories, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in locating candidates meeting that criterion. In the event
we complete a business combination, the success of our operations may be dependent upon management of the successor firm or venture
partner firm and numerous other factors beyond our control. 8 WE HAVE NO AGREEMENT FOR A BUSINESS COMBINATION
OR OTHER TRANSACTION. We have no agreement with respect to engaging
in a merger with, joint venture with or acquisition of, a private or public entity. No assurances can be given that we will successfully
identify and evaluate suitable business opportunities or that we will conclude a business combination. Management has not identified
any particular industry or specific business within an industry for evaluation. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to negotiate
a business combination on favorable terms, and there is consequently a risk that funds allocated to the purchase of our shares
will not be invested in a company with active business operations. MANAGEMENT WILL CHANGE UPON THE CONSUMMATION
OF A MERGER. After the closing of a merger or business
combination, it is likely our current management will not retain any control or managerial responsibilities. Upon such event, Mr.
Kling and Mr. Warshaw intend to resign from their positions with us. CURRENT STOCKHOLDERS WILL BE IMMEDIATELY
AND SUBSTANTIALLY DILUTED UPON A MERGER OR BUSINESS COMBINATION. Our Certificate of Incorporation authorized
the issuance of 100,000,000 shares of our Common Stock. There are currently 97,928,456 authorized but unissued shares of Common
Stock available for issuance. To the extent that additional shares of Common Stock are authorized and issued in connection with
a merger or business combination, our stockholders could experience significant dilution of their respective ownership interests.
Furthermore, the issuance of a substantial number of shares of Common Stock may adversely affect prevailing market prices, if any,
for our Common Stock and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities. CONTROL BY EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS. Hudson and Iroquois beneficially own almost
68% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock. As a result, these stockholders are able to exercise control over matters requiring
stockholder approval, including the election of directors, and the approval of mergers, consolidations and sales of all or substantially
all of our assets. OUR COMMON STOCK IS A "PENNY STOCK"
WHICH MAY RESTRICT THE ABILITY OF STOCKHOLDERS TO SELL OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE SECONDARY MARKET. The SEC has adopted regulations which generally
define "penny stock" to be an equity security that has a market price, as defined, of less than $5.00 per share, or an
exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions, including an exception of an equity security that is
quoted on a national securities exchange. Our Common Stock is not now quoted on a national exchange but is traded on the OTCQB
of the OTC Markets (“OTCQB”). Thus, they are subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on
broker-dealers who sell these securities. For example, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the
purchaser of such securities and have received the purchaser's written consent to the transactions prior to the purchase. Additionally,
the rules require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock
market. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered underwriter,
and current quotations for the securities, and, if the broker-dealer is the sole market maker, the broker-dealer must disclose
this fact and the broker-dealer's presumed control over the market. Finally, among other requirements, monthly statements must
be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny
stocks. The "penny stock" rules, may restrict the ability of our stockholders to sell our Common Stock and warrants in
the secondary market. 9 OUR COMMON STOCK HAS BEEN THINLY TRADED,
LIQUIDITY IS LIMITED, AND WE MAY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN LISTING OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON A MORE LIQUID MARKET. Our Common Stock is quoted on the OTCQB,
which provides significantly less liquidity than a securities exchange (such as the NYSE MKT, New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ).
There is uncertainty that we will ever be accepted for a listing on a national securities exchange. Often there is currently a limited volume of trading in our
Common Stock, and on many days there has been no trading activity at all. The purchasers of shares of our Common Stock may find
it difficult to resell their shares at prices quoted in the market or at all. ITEM 1B
