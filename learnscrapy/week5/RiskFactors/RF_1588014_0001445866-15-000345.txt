ITEM 1. B US INESS BACKGROUND We began operations in 1988, under the ownership and control of Ardell Mees, who provided installation services to grocery decor design companies. As our reputation for excellent workmanship has grown, we have expanded our operations to serve a larger geographic region. On January 4, 2001, we incorporated in North Dakota as ADM Enterprises, Inc. On May 9, 2006, the Company changed both its name to ADM Endeavors and its domicile to the state of Nevada. On July 1, 2008, the Company acquired all of the assets of ADM Enterprises, LLC, a sole proprietorship owned by Ardell and Tammera Mees, in exchange for 10,000,000 newly issued shares of our common stock. As a result, ADM Enterprises, LLC became a wholly owned subsidiary of Company. Even though the Company was incorporated on January 4, 2001, it had no operations until the share exchange agreement with ADM Enterprises, LLC on July 1, 2008. All business operations are those solely of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary ADM Enterprises, LLC. In May of 2013, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to provide for an increase in its’ authorized share capital. The authorized common stock increased to 800,000,000 shares at a par value of $0.001 per share and preferred stock increased to 80,000,000 at a par value of $0.001 per share. CURRENT BUSINESS OPERATIONS We began operations in 1988, under the ownership and control of Ardell Mees, who provided installation services to grocery decor design companies. As our reputation for excellent workmanship has grown, we have expanded our operations to serve a larger geographic region. On January 4, 2001, we incorporated in North Dakota as ADM Enterprises, Inc. On May 9, 2006, the Company changed both its name to ADM Endeavors and its domicile to the state of Nevada. On July 1, 2008, the Company acquired all of the assets of ADM Enterprises, LLC, a sole proprietorship owned by Ardell and Tammera Mees, in exchange for 10,000,000 newly issued shares of our common stock. As a result, ADM Enterprises, LLC became a wholly owned subsidiary of Company. Even though the Company was incorporated on January 4, 2001, it had no operations until the share exchange agreement with ADM Enterprises, LLC on July 1, 2008. All business operations are those solely of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary ADM Enterprises, LLC. We provide customized construction and installation of grocery store decor for both new and renovated grocery stores. Our service and expertise include the installation of grocery checkout stands, grid ceilings, cart-stops, shelving, customer service counter, office cabinetry and other grocery store equipment and fixtures. Our clients primarily consist of design companies, most of whom are subsidiaries of major retail grocery chains, or are affiliated with Associated Wholesale Grocers, the nation's second largest retailer-owned grocery wholesaler. We believe that our success is the result of both our quality installation of grocery equipment and fixtures, and high level of personal service that we provide to our customers. We receive bid requests from all regions of the United States. Therefore, we are seeking to expand our operations to service additional geographic areas. In 2013 the majority of our contracts have been in the Midwestern United States including North Dakota, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Oaklahoma and Texas. Over the past 25 years, ADM has completed projects in 25 States including N.D., S.D., MN., MT., NB., WY., KS., CO., OK., IL., ID., IN., IA., AK., MS., TX., TN., KY., MI, OH., PA., CA., NV., and FL. The main focus of our expansion plan includes primarily the Midwestern United States including the states of N.D., S.D., MN., IA., WI., WY., NB., and KS., as well as some southern states such as TX., OK., MS., and KS. 1 Table of Contents To effectuate our business plan during the next twelve months, we must increase our current customer base, as well as acquire additional employees and equipment so that we may accommodate our expanded customer base. We anticipate that we will establish an online presence to increase our market visibility and corporate recognition. We believe we can establish our industry presence and stimulate interest by constructing a trade show booth to market our services when we attend annual grocer tradeshows and conventions. Use of Grocery Decor Installation Services in the Construction and Remodeling Industry has grown tremendously in recent years. The retail grocery industry is highly competitive and requires constant innovations to attract and retain customers. Accordingly, neighborhood markets battle for patrons by catering to customers' desires for a modern, clean, and convenient shopping experience. Grocery stores, therefore, typically renovate every five to six years to maintain a new image. In the past, store workers, painters or carpenters installed decor items. However, as the designs and materials became increasingly elaborate, the need for specialized and experienced installers grew. The installation process requires that an installer have special knowledge of various aspects of construction, including framing, finishing, and remodeling. Additionally, knowledge of standards for product usage, hanging methods and quality control are extremely helpful. As a result of the frequency of store renovations, coupled with the complexity of the items being installed secures the demand for custom installation services. Bankruptcy or Similar Proceedings There has been no bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding pertaining to the Company. Reorganizations, Purchase or Sale of Assets There have been no material reclassifications, mergers, consolidations, or purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets not done in the ordinary course of business pertaining to the Company. Patents, Trademarks, Franchises, Concessions, Royalty Agreements, or Labor Contracts Employees The Company only has one employment agreement with its chief executive officer and chief financial officer. On January 3, 2013, the Company executed a 2 year employment agreement with Ardell D. Mees, the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer. As compensation for services, Mr. Mees is to receive an annual base salary of $72,000. 2 Table of Contents ITEM 1A. RI SK FACTORS An investment in these securities involves an exceptionally high degree of risk and is extremely speculative in nature. Following are what we believe are all the material risks involved if you decide to purchase shares in this offering . The risks described below are the ones we believe are most important for you to consider. These risks are not the only ones that we face. If events anticipated by any of the following risks actually occur, our business, operating results or financial condition could suffer and the price of our common stock could decline. Risks Relating To Our Business Our operating results will be difficult to predict and fluctuations in them may cause volatility in the price of our shares. Given the nature of the grocery store markets in which we compete, our revenues and profitability may be difficult to predict for many reasons, including the following: · Operating results may be highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received from retailers seeking construction and installation of grocery store decor during any one quarter, which are difficult to forecast. Customers generally order on an as-needed basis and we typically will not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers. As a result, our revenues in any quarter will depend primarily on orders received during that quarter. · We must incur a large portion of our costs in advance of orders because we must plan research and production, and installation, order components and enter into development, sales and marketing, and other operating commitments prior to obtaining firm commitments from our customers. This will make it difficult for us to adjust our costs in response to a revenue shortfall, which could adversely affect our operating results. Construction and production capacities that do not match demand for our products could result in lost sales or in a reduction in our gross margins. Our industry is characterized by frequent new product and or design introductions, short-term customer commitments and volatile changes in demand. We will determine capacities based on our forecasts of demand for our services and products. Actual demand for our services and products will depend on many factors, which will make it difficult to forecast. The following problems could occur as a result of these differences: · If demand for our products is below our forecasts, we could produce excess personnel or have excess installation capacity. Excess personnel could negatively impact our cash flows and could result in higher construction, installation and design costs. · If demand for our products exceeds our forecasts, we could have to rapidly ramp up production. We will also depend on suppliers and manufacturers to provide components and sub-assemblies. As a result, we may not be able to increase our production levels to meet unexpected demand and could lose sales in the short term while we try to increase production. If customers turn to competitive sources of supply to meet their needs, our revenues could be adversely affected. · Rapidly increasing our production levels to meet unanticipated grocery customer demand could result in higher costs for grocery components and sub-assemblies, increased expenditures for freight to expedite delivery of grocery materials or finished goods, and higher overtime costs and other expenses. These higher expenditures could result in lower gross margins. 3 Table of Contents If we do not timely introduce successful grocery store designs and products, our business and operating results could suffer. The market for our services and products is characterized by rapidly evolving industry standards, short product life cycles and frequent new product introductions. As a result, we must continually introduce new products and technologies and enhance existing products in order to remain competitive. The success of our new products will depend on several factors, including our ability to: (i) anticipate technology and grocery store market trends; (ii) timely develop innovative new products and enhancements for grocery stores; (iii) distinguish our products from those of our competitors; (iv) manufacture and deliver high-quality products and provide high-quality services; and (v) price our products and services competitively. Our failure to manage growth could harm it. We intend to significantly expand the number and types of grocery stock products and services we will sell and we will endeavor to further expand our service and product portfolio. This expansion may place a significant strain on our management, operations and resources. Specifically, the areas that may be strained most by our growth will include the following: · New product and service launch. With the growth of our service and product portfolio, we may experience increased complexity in coordinating product development, installation and commissioning. As the complexity increases, it may place a strain on our ability to accurately coordinate the commercial launch of our services and products with adequate support to meeting anticipated customer demand. If we are unable to scale and improve our product and installation launch coordination, we could frustrate our customers and lose earned space and product sales. · Forecasting, planning and supply chain logistics. With the growth of our product portfolio, we may also e xperience increased complexity in forecasting grocery customer demand and in planning for production and transportation and logistics management. If we are unable to scale and improve our forecasting, planning and logistics management, we could frustrate our customers, lose product sales or accumulate excess inventory. To manage the growth of our operations, we will need to continue to improve our transaction processing, operational and financial systems, and procedures and controls to effectively manage the increased complexity. If we are unable to scale and improve them, the consequences could include delays in shipment of product, degradation in levels of customer support, lost sales and increased inventory. These difficulties could harm or limit our ability to expand. If we do not compete effectively, demand for our grocery store products and installations could decline and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Our industry is intensely competitive. It is characterized by a trend of slowly rising average selling prices in the grocery market, and continual performance enhancements and new features, as well as rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors in its grocery store market. Also, aggressive industry pricing practices and downward pressure on margins may result in increased price competition from both our primary competitors as well as from less established ones. If we do not continue to distinguish our grocery store products and installations through distinctive, technologically advanced features, design and services, as well as continue to build and strengthen our brand recognition, our business could be harmed. If we do not otherwise compete effectively, demand for our products will decline, our gross margins could decrease, we would lose market share, and our revenues could decline. We depend on OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) and contract manufacturers who may not have adequate capacity to fulfill our needs or may not meet our quality and delivery objectives. The primary suppliers of the components which we install in grocery stores are also the largest source of our contracts. They include DGS of Salt Lake City Utah which is a division of Supervalue stores with 3,400 stores with whom we have been working with for the past 25 years since 1988. DGS of Kansas City, Kansas is a division of Associated Wholesale Grocers with 2,900 stores which we have been working with for the last 19 years and Reso/Nantz International of Lubbock, Texas whom we have worked with since 2005. Within the areas of The United States in which ADM operates, these three companies would be considered the most prominent manufacturers of interior grocery store decor components. 4 Table of Contents Original component manufacturers and contractors produce our product lines. Our reliance on them will involve significant risks, including reduced control over quality and logistics management, the potential lack of adequate capacity and discontinuance of the contractors’ assembly processes. Financial instability of our manufacturers or contractors could result in us having to find new suppliers, which could increase our costs and delay our product and installation deliveries. These manufacturers and contractors may also choose to discontinue building its products for a variety of reasons. Consequently, we may experience delays in the timeliness, quality and adequacy in product and installation deliveries, any of which could harm our business and operating results. We may purchase key grocery store components and products from single or limited sources, and our business and operating results could be harmed if supply were delayed or constrained or if there were shortages of required components. Lead times for materials and components ordered by us or our contract manufacturers can vary significantly and depend on factors, such as the specific supplier, contract terms and demand for a grocery store component at a given time. We do not have any established contractual relations with our suppliers for key grocery store components. From time to time, we may thus experience supply shortages and fluctuations in component prices. While we will try to manage our component levels through the purchase of buffer stock, there is no guarantee that we will be able to maintain the inventory levels sufficient to meet our product demand. In addition, we may be at risk for these components if our customers reject or cancel orders unexpectedly or with inadequate notice. Shortages or interruptions in the supply of components or subcontracted products, or our inability to procure these components or products from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner could delay shipment and installation of our products or increase our production or installation costs, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results. We may purchase some products and some key components used in our grocery store products from single or limited sources. If the supply of these products or key components were to be delayed or constrained, we may be unable to find a new supplier on acceptable terms or at all or our new and existing product shipment could be delayed. Any of this could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Our introduction of any new grocery store product lines may consume significant resources and not result in significant future revenues. We may expand our grocery store product offerings with new product lines that are outside of our traditional areas of expertise. To accomplish this, we will need to commit resources to develop, sell and market these new products. With limited experience in these grocery store product lines and because these products may be based on technologies that are new to us, it may be difficult for us to accurately anticipate and forecast revenues, customer support costs and product returns. Our investments in the development and marketing of new lines of grocery store products could produce higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues. We may be unable to protect our proprietary rights. Our future success depends in part on our proprietary technology, technical know-how and other intellectual property. We rely on intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, such as nondisclosure terms, to protect our intellectual property. Others may independently develop similar technology, duplicate our products, or design around our intellectual property rights. In addition, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our product and installation services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Any of these events could significantly harm our business, financial condition and operating results. We may also reliance on technologies that we acquire from others. We may rely on third parties for further required technologies. We may purchase a computer's logic component or other technological devices from outside sources and will need to pay annual fees to enable us to get updates'/upgrades and technical support to the logic portion of the system or device. We may find it necessary or desirable in the future to obtain licenses or other rights relating to one or more if our products or to current or future technologies. These licenses or other rights may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Moreover, the use of intellectual property licensed from third parties may limit our ability to protect the proprietary rights in our products. 5 Table of Contents We are an "emerging growth company," and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors. We are an "emerging growth company," as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, delay compliance with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until they are made applicable to private companies, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although we could lose that status sooner if our revenues exceed $1 billion, if we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three year period, or if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any September 30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. We have decided to take advantage of the exemptions provided to emerging growth companies and as a result our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. In addition, some investors might find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. Our future success depends on our ability to retain our key employees. We are dependent on the services of Ardell Mees, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and member of our Board. Other than non-compete provisions of limited duration included in employment agreements that we may or will have with certain executives, we do not generally seek non-compete agreements with key personnel, and they may leave and subsequently compete against us. The loss of service of any of our senior management team, particularly those who are not party to employment agreements with us, or our failure to attract and retain other qualified and experienced personnel on acceptable terms, could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may be unable to attract and retain the skilled employees needed to sustain and grow our business. Our success to date has largely depended on, and will continue to depend on, the skills, efforts and motivations of our executive team and employees, who generally have significant experience with our Company and within the construction and installation of grocery store decor industry. Our success will also depend largely on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified interior decoration engineers and construction contractors and general corporate management personnel. We may find difficulties in locating and hiring qualified grocery store decor personnel and in retaining such personnel once hired, which may materially and adversely affect our business. We may need additional capital in the future, but there is no assurance that funds will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. We may need to raise additional funds in order to achieve growth or fund other business initiatives. This financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us and may be dilutive to existing stockholders if raised through additional equity offerings. Additionally, any securities issued to raise funds may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to expand, develop or enhance services or products, or respond to competitive pressures may be materially limited. 6 Table of Contents Any existing indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and we may not be able to fulfill our debt obligations. Any proposed indebtedness may contain various covenants that may limit our ability to, among other things: (i) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends or make other distributions to our stockholders; (iii) make restricted payments; (iv) engage in transactions with affiliates; and (v) enter into proposed business transactions or combinations. These restrictions could limit our ability to withstand general economic downturns that could affect our business, obtain future financing, make acquisitions or capital expenditures, conduct operations or otherwise capitalize on business opportunities that may arise. Additionally, if we incur substantial debt for working capital purposes, we may use a significant portion of our cash flow to pay interest on our outstanding debt, limiting the amount available for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. We may be more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions than less leveraged competitors and thus less able to withstand competitive pressures. If our cash flow is inadequate to make interest and principal payments on our debt, we might have to refinance our indebtedness or issue additional equity or other securities and may not be successful in those efforts or may not obtain terms favorable to us. Additionally, our ability to finance working capital needs and general corporate purposes for the public and private markets, as well as the associated cost of funding, is dependent, in part, on our credit ratings, which may be adversely affected if we experience declining service revenue. Any of these events could reduce our ability to generate cash available for investment or debt repayment or to make improvements or respond to events that would enhance profitability. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED ST AF F COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PRO PE RTIES Description of Property The company currently maintains its’ principle office at 2021 N. 3 rd St. Bismarck, N.D 58501. At this location Ardell D. Mees provides 2 office spaces for the exclusive use of the company. No monthly fee is being charged to the company as management believes such cost is nominal and so forth does not recognize any rent expense in the financial statements. The company rents 1 storage unit for exclusive use of the company in Mandan, N.D for a total cost of $1,560 per year ITEM 3. LEGAL PROC EE DINGS There are no current, past, pending or threatened legal proceedings or administrative actions either by or against the issuer that could have a material effect on the issuer’s business, financial condition, or operations. ITEM 4. MINE SAFET Y DISCLOSURES Not applicable. P AR T II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RE LAED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES MARKET INFORMATION The Company accepted effective status as a reporting company on September 18, 2013 through the filing of an S-1 registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As of the filing date, there is no market for the Company's stock. The Company is working with a market maker and is planning to submit its application to FINRA to acquire a ticker symbol in the near future. The Company plans on listing the stock for quotation on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board and will submit an application with FINRA for the trading symbol MTMI. 7 Table of Contents HOLDERS The approximate number of stockholders of record at December 31, 2014 is 41. The number of stockholders of record does not include beneficial owners of our common stock, whose shares are held in the names of various dealers, clearing agencies, banks, brokers and other fiduciaries. DIVIDEND POLICY No dividends have ever been declared by the Board of Directors on our common stock. Our losses do not currently indicate the ability to pay any cash dividends, and we do not have the intention of paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We do not have any equity compensation plans. We do not have any warrants issued or outstanding. RECENT SALES OF UNREGISTREED SECURITIES Common and preferred shares authorized The Company was incorporated on January 4, 2001, at which time the Company authorized 300,000,000 shares of common Stock with $0.001 par value and 30,000,000 shares of preferred Stock with $0.001 par value. In May of 2013, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to provide for an increase in its’ authorized share capital. The authorized common stock increased to 800,000,000 shares at a par value of $0.001 per share and preferred stock increased to 80,000,000 at a par value of $0.001 per share. On June 5, 2013, the Company designated 80,000,000 preferred shares as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock which has the voting power equal to 100 common shares per each share of preferred stock. Each Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into 10 common shares at any time by the holder. Preferred shares issued On June 10, 2013, the Company issued 20,000,000 Series A Convertible Preferred Shares to its CEO, Ardell Mees, for executive services performed on behalf of the Company. On September 20, 2013, the Company canceled the 20,000,000 preferred shares to Ardell Mees. The Board of Director’s believes it is in the Company’s best interest to cancel the 20,000,000 preferred shares because they would substantially dilute the market value of the Company’s stock if converted to common shares. Common shares issued On June 7, 2013, the Company issued 2,250,000 shares to a Calvin Mees, a related party consultant, for various services performed which include the development of a business plan for the expansion of the Company’s operations, preparation of news releases, investor affairs, and other business related services. The shares were valued at $0.001 per share which resulted in the Company recording a consulting expense of $2,250. The consulting services provided were completed by June 30, 2013. The consultant is a related party to the Company as he is the brother of Ardell, Mees, the Company’s CEO. The Company has had no recent sales of stock for cash nor has the Company had an independent valuation of the Company’s stock price. Therefore, management valued the shares at par value $0.001. The Company did not issue any new shares of common stock in the year ended December 31, 2014. At the date of this filing, the Company had 117,795,000 share of common stock outstanding, respectively. 8 Table of Contents Share Exchange Agreement On July 1, 2008 the Company executed a share exchange agreement with ADM Enterprises LLC whereby the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of ADM Enterprises LLC for 10,000,000 newly issued shares of the Company’s common stock. As a result, ADM Enterprises LLC became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company shares the same officers, Ardell Mees and Tammera Mees, with ADM Enterprises LLC. Since the share exchange agreement was between related parties, there was no goodwill or excess consideration recorded. SECURITIES AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE UNDER EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS. As of December 31, 2014, we had no compensation plans under which our equity securities were authorized for issuance. PENNY STOCK REGULATION Shares of our common stock will probably be subject to rules adopted the SEC that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in “penny stocks.” Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in those securities is provided by the exchange or system). The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC, which contains the following: ● a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading; ● a description of the broker’s or dealer’s duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to violation to such duties or other requirements of securities’ laws; ● a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including “bid” and “ask” prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the “bid” and “ask” price; ● a toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions; ● definitions of significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading in penny stocks; and ● such other information and is in such form (including language, type, size and format), as the SEC shall require by rule or regulation. Prior to effecting any transaction in penny stock, the broker-dealer also must provide the customer the following: ● the bid and offer quotations for the penny stock; ● the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction; ● the number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock; and ● monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for a stock that becomes subject to the penny stock rules. Holders of shares of our common stock may have difficulty selling those shares because our common stock will probably be subject to the penny stock rules. 9 Table of Contents ITEM 6. SELECTED FI NA NCIAL DATA Not applicable. ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AN D ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ TOGETHER WITH THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT ON FORM 10-K. The following discussion reflects our plan of operation. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements which are included in this Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expected financial position, business and financing plans. These statements involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Report. Unless the context otherwise suggests, “we,” “our,” “us,” and similar terms, all refer to ADM Endeavors, Inc. as of the date of this report. To effectuate our business plan during the next twelve months, we must increase our current customer base, as well as acquire additional employees and equipment so that we may accommodate our expanded customer base. We anticipate that we will establish an online presence to increase our market visibility and corporate recognition by the second quarter of 2014, through our websites, www.admendeavors.com and www.admenterprises.net, which are currently under construction. We believe we can establish our industry presence and stimulate interest by constructing a trade show booth to market our services when we attend annual grocer tradeshows and conventions. Going concern The Company’s independent auditor included an explanatory paragraph in their audit report for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 with respect to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Current and planned operations Currently, the Company has to travel to and from its only office in North Dakota to the mid-west to bid and compete for sales. The Company hopes to expand operations by opening a satellite office in the mid-western region whereby we could aggressively bid on projects easier and more efficiently. The Company also plans to mitigate the uncertainty of the U.S. economy by increasing its customer base to include mid-sized grocery chains as well. The large national supermarket chains usually remodel their stores every (4) four to (6) six years. The Company has noticed that national chains will more typically begin remodeling projects in the second half of the year, with completion before the holiday season. The majority of the Company’s revenues are derived from Super Valu, Inc or Associated Wholesale Grocers which are 2 of many interior grocery store décor design companies. The contracts we are awarded can be anywhere from 1 week to 1 month, depending on how large the store is. It normally takes 21-30 days upon completion of projects to be paid in full. 10 Table of Contents Below is a list of planned district offices for the company and the geographical areas they will serve. Through the Company’s efforts to go public and enter the equities markets, the Company is seeking to secure additional funds from outside investors to execute its planned expanded operations in the near future. The Company has not entered into any agreements, verbal or written, with regards to securing additional funding necessary to finance planned future operations. Moreover, there are no agreements in place with any officer of the Company nor with outside entities to fund the Company if it were to have a shortfall in capital. It is estimated that each of the Company’s five targeted expansion areas will require approximately $200,000 each in startup capital for a total of $1,000,000 over a 2 year rollout period. District Location Geographic Area Target Date Kansas City, MO Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas 6-1-15 Minneapolis, MN Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Northern Illinois, and the UP of Michigan 9-1-15 Denver, CO Colorado, Wyoming, Western Nebraska, and Western Kansas 12-1-15 Chicago, Ill Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Eastern Wisconsin 6-1-16 Spokane, WA Washington, California, Idaho, and Montana 9-1-16 Results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $210,633 compared to $243,927 for the year ended December 31, 2013 which was a decrease of $33,294. The decrease in revenues was the result of the Company executing less design contracts. The Company is refining its bidding technique and believes in the long run it will be able to obtain more contracts than its competitors and provide a better service using its expertise and deep knowledge of the industry. The Company has been successful in driving sales through its main customer Associated Wholesale Grocers. Revenues from Associated Wholesale Grocers made up approximately 88% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014. Cost of Revenues The gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 68% of sales compared to 66% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in gross margin was due to less subcontractor costs associated with major projects. The Company closely monitors its cost of revenues and anticipates the gross margin will decrease in the next two years as the Company expands operations. The Company believes once it gets a foothold in the mid-west with its proposed satellite office, it will generate higher revenues while increasing the current gross margin. Currently, the Company has a high travel cost due to the distance to jobsites and potential customers. With an investment in a satellite office, the Company will be able to lower its travel expenses. Currently, the greatest costs of revenues are subcontracting fees and travel costs to the mid-western USA where a majority of the large customers are located. The Company plans to hire and train a few select sales managers who would work out of the satellite office. They will then be closer to the action where they can efficiently oversee future projects. Currently, the executives of the Company are traveling long distances to oversee the majority of the larger job sites. Operating Expenses General and administrative expense were $51,844 for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $55,197 for the year ended December 31, 2013, resulting in a decrease of $3,353. The decrease was minimal due to less cost related to administrative duties. 11 Table of Contents Consulting was $5,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $2,250 for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in consulting fees was from an outside third party accounting firm. Officer compensation was $86,439 for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $72,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013 which was an increase of $14,439. The increase in officer compensation expense was due to compensation paid to our Secretary whom is also the wife of our chief executive officer. The Company has an employment agreement with its chief executive officer for an annual salary of $72,000. Travel expenses were $20,502 for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $22,528 for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in travel costs was primarily due to the contracted locations being closer to our headquarters. Operating Loss Total operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $20,647 as compared to the operating gain for the year ended December 31, 2013 of $8,490 which was an increase in operating loss of $29,137. The increase in operating loss was due to less revenue and less non-cash stock for services expense. 12 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 Our cash balance is $11,009 as of December 31, 2014 as compared to $38,879 as of December 31, 2013. Management believes it will need additional funding to support operating activities in the next twelve months if the Company is to execute its planned future operations which will require it to hire and train future sales managers to work from a satellite office in the mid-western United States. Management believes this will strategically position the Company to increase revenues while controlling travel costs. As of December 31, 2014, total current assets were $11,009 as compared to $38,879 at December 31, 2013. The decrease of $27,870 was from the cash balance entirely. As of December 31, 2014, total current liabilities were $163,402 as compared to $144,035 at December 31, 2013. The increase of $19,367 was from mainly due to the note payable for the purchase of an automobile. Operating Activities During the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash used by operating activities was $20,049 which consisted of a net loss of $21,536; offset by depreciation expense of $9,324, $10,000 of accounts payable and $17,837 of accrued salary. Net cashed provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 of $27,517 which consisted of net income of $8,490; offset by $2,250 of stock for services expense, $919 of depreciation expense and $15,858 of accrued salary. Investing Activities During the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash used by investing activities was $35,025 which consisted of the purchase of an automobile. During the year ended December 31, 2013, net cash used by investing activities was $-0-. 13 Table of Contents Financing Activities During the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by financing activities were $27,204 which was from a $30,015 note payable executed pursuant to the purchase of an automobile and $2,811 in payments against the note payable. During the year ended December 31, 2013, net cash used by financing activities were $-0-. Through the Company’s efforts to go public and enter the equities markets, the Company is seeking to secure additional funds from outside investors to execute its planned expanded operations in the near future. The Company has not entered into any agreements, verbal or written, with regards to securing additional funding necessary to finance planned future operations. In the past, Mr. Mees has funded shortfalls in capital through short term shareholder loans which bear no interest and are payable on demand. As of the date of this prospectus, there is a zero shareholder loan balance. There is currently no agreement with Mr. Mees to fund the Company with funds raised through this offering. It is estimated that each of the Company’s five targeted expansion areas will require approximately $200,000 each in start-up capital for a total of $1,000,000 over a 2 year rollout period. Seasonality The large national supermarket chains usually remodel their stores every (4) four to (6) six years. The Company has noticed that national chains will more typically begin remodeling projects in the second half of the year, with completion before the holiday season. Impact of Inflation General inflation in the economy has driven the operating expenses of many businesses higher. We will continuously seek methods of reducing costs and streamlining operations while maximizing efficiency through improved internal operating procedures and controls. While we are subject to inflation as described above, our management believes that inflation currently does not have a material effect on our operating results. However, inflation may become a factor in the future. Critical Accounting Policies Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. Such estimates include management’s assessments of the carrying value of certain assets, useful lives of assets, and related depreciation and amortization methods applied. Revenue Recognition The Company follows paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition. The Company will recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. In addition, the Company records allowances for accounts receivable that are estimated to not be collected. Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include all of the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary AMD Enterprises, LLC as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 for the periods then ended. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 14 Table of Contents Property and Equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for major additions and betterments are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over the assets estimated useful life of three (3) years for equipment, (5) years for automobile, and (7) years for furniture and fixtures. Upon sale or retirement of property and equipment, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in statements of operations. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We conduct all of our transactions, including those with foreign suppliers and customers, in U.S. dollars. We are therefore not directly subject to the risks of foreign currency fluctuations and do not hedge or otherwise deal in currency instruments in an attempt to minimize such risks. Demand from foreign customers and the ability or willingness of foreign suppliers to perform their obligations to us may be affected by the relative change in value of such customer or supplier’s domestic currency to the value of the U.S. dollar. Furthermore, changes in the relative value of the U.S. dollar may change the price of our products relative to the prices of our foreign competitors. Stock-Based Compensation We recognize compensation cost for stock-based awards based on the estimated fair value of the award on date of grant. We measure compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize compensation cost upon the probable attainment of a specified performance condition or over a service period. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements We have decided to take advantage of the exemptions provided to emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act and as a result our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. We may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, delay compliance with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until they are made applicable to private companies. Company management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements. OFF-BALANCE SHEET TRANSACTIONS We currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. Management’s Responsibility for Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United State of America; this includes the design, implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditor’s Responsibility My responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on my audits. I conducted my audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that I plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor was I engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. My audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, I express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement presentation. I believe that my audits provide a reasonable basis for my opinion. Opinion In my opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of ADM Endeavors, Inc. as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Emphasis of Matter The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has a minimum cash balance available for payment of ongoing operating expenses, has experienced losses from operations since inception, and it does not have a source of revenue sufficient to cover its operating costs. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in this regard are described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. /s/ Terry L.

F-5 Table of Contents ADM ENDEAVORS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND 2013 NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS We began operations in 1988, under the ownership and control of Ardell Mees, who provided installation services to grocery decor design companies. As our reputation for excellent workmanship has grown, we have expanded our operations to serve a larger geographic region. On January 4, 2001, we incorporated in North Dakota as ADM Enterprises, Inc. On May 9, 2006, the Company changed both its name to ADM Endeavors and its domicile to the state of Nevada. On July 1, 2008, the Company acquired all of the assets of ADM Enterprises, LLC, a sole proprietorship owned by Ardell and Tammera Mees, in exchange for 10,000,000 newly issued shares of our common stock. As a result, ADM Enterprises, LLC became a wholly owned subsidiary of Company. Even though the Company was incorporated on January 4, 2001, it had no operations until the share exchange agreement with ADM Enterprises, LLC on July 1, 2008. All business operations are those solely of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary ADM Enterprises, LLC. In May of 2013, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to provide for an increase in its’ authorized share capital. The authorized common stock increased to 800,000,000 shares at a par value of $0.001 per share and preferred stock increased to 80,000,000 at a par value of $0.001 per share. NOTE 2 -SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of presentation The Company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). It is management's opinion, however, that all material adjustments (consisting of normal and recurring adjustments) have been made which are necessary for a fair financial statements presentation. Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include all of the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary AMD Enterprises, LLC as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 for the periods then ended. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Going Concern The Company has generated limited profits and may experience losses in the near term. We will be dependent on sales of our equity securities and debt financing to meet our cash requirements for the future proposed expansion of operations. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $12,837,124. The Company needs to maintain a steady operating structure, ensuring that expenses are contained such that profits are consistently achieved. In order to expand the Company’s business, the Company would likely require additional financing. Management of the Company must continually develop and refine its strategies and goals in order to execute the business plan of the Company on a broad scale and expand the business. F-6 Table of Contents Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. Such estimates include management’s assessments of the carrying value of certain assets, useful lives of assets, and related depreciation and amortization methods applied. Cash equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. At December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the Company had no cash equivalents. Fair value of financial instruments The Company adopted the provisions of FASB ASC 820 (the “Fair Value Topic”) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The Fair Value Topic defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. It requires that valuation techniques maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. It also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the valuation inputs into three broad levels. The following fair value hierarchy is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used in order to value the assets and liabilities: A) Market approach—Uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. Prices may be indicated by pricing guides, sale transactions, market trades, or other sources; B) Cost approach—Based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement cost); and C) Income approach—Uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount based on current market expectations about the future amounts (includes present value techniques, and option-pricing models). Net present value is an income approach where a stream of expected cash flows is discounted at an appropriate market interest rate. Level 1: Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. An active market for an asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with significant frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs. Example of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities and quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. Level 3: Unobservable inputs based on the Company’s assessment of the assumptions that are market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The carrying amount of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and deferred revenue approximate their fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments. The Company’s note payable approximate the fair value of such instruments based upon management’s best estimate of interest rates that would be available to the Company for similar financial arrangements at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 and 2012. The Company had no assets and/or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively, using the market and income approaches. F-7 Table of Contents Property and Equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for major additions and betterments are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over the assets estimated useful life of three (3) years for equipment, (5) years for automobile, and (7) years for furniture and fixtures. Upon sale or retirement of property and equipment, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in statements of operations. Impairment of long-lived assets The Company follows paragraph 360-10-05-4 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for its long-lived assets. The Company’s long-lived assets, such as intellectual property, are required to be reviewed for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The Company assesses the recoverability of its long-lived assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related long-lived asset or group of long-lived assets over their remaining estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. Fair value is generally determined using the asset’s expected future discounted cash flows or market value, if readily determinable. If long-lived assets are determined to be recoverable, but the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives are shorter than originally estimated, the net book values of the long-lived assets are depreciated over the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives. The Company determined that there were no impairments of long-lived assets as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013. Commitments and contingencies The Company follows subtopic 450-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report accounting for contingencies. Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. Revenue recognition The Company follows paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition. The Company will recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. In addition, the Company records allowances for accounts receivable that are estimated to not be collected. F-8 Table of Contents Stock-Based Compensation In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation . Under FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718, companies are required to measure the compensation costs of share-based compensation arrangements based on the grant-date fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide services. Share-based compensation arrangements include stock options, restricted share plans, performance-based awards, share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans. As such, compensation cost is measured on the date of grant at their fair value. Such compensation amounts, if any, are amortized over the respective vesting periods of the option grant. The Company applies this statement prospectively. Equity instruments (“instruments”) issued to other than employees are recorded on the basis of the fair value of the instruments, as required by FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718. FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 505, Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees defines the measurement date and recognition period for such instruments. In general, the measurement date is when either a (a) performance commitment, as defined, is reached or (b) the earlier of (i) the non-employee performance is complete or (ii) the instruments are vested. The measured value related to the instruments is recognized over a period based on the facts and circumstances of each particular grant as defined in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Net income (loss) per share The Company computes basic and diluted earnings per share amounts pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders, by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, excluding the effects of any potentially dilutive securities. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares of common stock during the period. The diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted as of the first day of the year for any potentially diluted debt or equity. There were potentially no dilutive shares outstanding as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013. Subsequent events The Company follows the guidance in Section 855-10-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the disclosure of subsequent events. The Company will evaluate subsequent events through the date when the financial statements were issued. Recently issued accounting pronouncements We have decided to take advantage of the exemptions provided to emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act and as a result our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. We may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, delay compliance with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until they are made applicable to private companies. Company management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements. Reliance on Key Personnel and Consultants The Company is heavily dependent on the continued active participation of their current executive officers, employees and key personnel. The loss of any of the senior management or key employees could significantly and negatively impact the business until adequate replacements can be identified and put in place. F-9 Table of Contents NOTE 3 – SHARE EXCHANGE AGREEMENT On July 1, 2008 the Company executed a share exchange agreement with ADM Enterprises LLC whereby the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of ADM Enterprises LLC for 10,000,000 newly issued shares of the Company’s common stock. As a result, ADM Enterprises LLC became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company shares the same officers, Ardell Mees and Tammera Mees, with ADM Enterprises LLC. Since the share exchange agreement was between related parties, there was no goodwill or excess consideration recorded. NOTE 4 – PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Fixed assets, stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, consisted of the following: December 31, 2014 December 31, 2013 Equipment $ 14,825 $ 14,825 Automobile 89,125 54,100 Less: Accumulated Depreciation (75,181 ) (65,857 ) Property and Equipment, net $ 28,769 $ 3,068 Depreciation expense Depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $9,324 and $919, respectively. NOTE 5 – NOTE PAYABLE On March 3, 2014, the Company purchased a 2010 RV Heartland Road Warrior to use for projects that require management to work extended stays on location. The Company paid $5,000 as a down payment and financed $30,015 with 4.122% APR due on March 10, 2021. The loan calls for monthly payments of $412. F-10 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2014, the Company has a note payable balance of $27,204. NOTE 6 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Free office space provided by chief executive officer The Company has been provided office space by its chief executive officer Ardell Mees at no cost. Management has determined that such cost is nominal and did not recognize the rent expense in its financial statements. Share exchange agreement On July 1, 2008 the Company executed a share exchange agreement with ADM Enterprises LLC whereby the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of ADM Enterprises LLC for 10,000,000 newly issued shares of the Company’s common stock. As a result, ADM Enterprises LLC became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company shares the same officers, Ardell Mees and Tammera Mees, with ADM Enterprises LLC. Since the share exchange agreement was between related parties, there was no goodwill or excess consideration recorded. Employment Agreement On January 3, 2013, the Company executed a 2 year employment agreement with Ardell D. Mees, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. As compensation for services, Mr. Mees is to receive an annual base salary of $72,000. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 the Company accrued $72,000 in compensation expense to Mr. Mees in officer compensation. In the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company made cash payments to Mr. Mees against his accrued salary in the amounts of $89,838 and $47,547. F-11 Table of Contents NOTE 7 – STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Common and preferred shares authorized The Company was incorporated on January 4, 2001, at which time the Company authorized 300,000,000 shares of common Stock with $0.001 par value and 30,000,000 shares of preferred Stock with $0.001 par value. In May of 2013, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to provide for an increase in its’ authorized share capital. The authorized common stock increased to 800,000,000 shares at a par value of $0.001 per share and preferred stock increased to 80,000,000 at a par value of $0.001 per share. On June 5, 2013, the Company designated 80,000,000 preferred shares as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock which has the voting power equal to 100 common shares per each share of preferred stock. Each Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into 10 common shares at any time by the holder. Preferred shares issued On June 10, 2013, the Company issued 20,000,000 Series A Convertible Preferred Shares to its CEO, Ardell Mees, for executive services performed on behalf of the Company. On September 20, 2013, the Company canceled the 20,000,000 preferred shares to Ardell Mees. The Board of Director’s believes it is in the Company’s best interest to cancel the 20,000,000 preferred shares because they would substantially dilute the market value of the Company’s stock if converted to common shares. Common shares issued On June 7, 2013, the Company issued 2,250,000 shares to a Calvin Mees, a related party consultant, for various services performed which include the development of a business plan for the expansion of the Company’s operations, preparation of news releases, investor affairs, and other business related services. The shares were valued at $0.001 per share which resulted in the Company recording a consulting expense of $2,250. The consulting services provided were completed by June 30, 2013. The consultant is a related party to the Company as he is the brother of Ardell, Mees, the Company’s CEO. The Company has had no recent sales of stock for cash nor has the Company had an independent valuation of the Company’s stock price. Therefore, management valued the shares at par value $0.001. The Company did not issue any new shares of common stock in the year ended December 31, 2014. NOTE 8 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Management has evaluated subsequent events pursuant to the requirements of ASC Topic 855 and has determined that other than listed below, no material subsequent events exist. 1. On January 3, 2015, the Company renewed its employment agreement with its chief executive officer Ardell Mees for another two years. F-12 Table of Contents ITEM 9. CHANGES AND DISAGREEMENT WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE On January 22, 2014, the Company accepted the resignation of Patrick Rodgers, CPA, P.A. (“Rodgers”) from his engagement to be the independent certifying accountant for the Company. Effective March 6, 2014, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") revoked the registration of Patrick Rodgers, CPA, PA. due to Rogers’ violations of PCAOB rules and auditing standards in auditing the financial statements and PCAOB rules and quality control standards with respect to Rogers’ clients; the Registrant was not one of the clients for which Rogers was sanctioned. You can find a copy of the order at http://pcaobus.org/Enforcement/Decisions/Documents/2014_Rodgers.pdf The audit report of Rodgers on the Company's financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 and through January 22, 2014, did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, nor was it qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. During the Company's 2012 and 2011 fiscal years and through the date of March 6, 2014, there were no disagreements with Rodgers on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Rodgers, would have caused Rodgers to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with their report, and there were no “reportable events” as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. On January 22, 2014, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the engagement of Terry L. Johnson, CPA, as the Company's independent accountant effective immediately to audit the Company’s financial statements and to perform reviews of interim financial statements. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 through January 22, 2014 neither the Company nor anyone acting on its behalf consulted with Terry L. Johnson, CPA regarding (i) either the application of any accounting principles to a specific completed or contemplated transaction of the Company, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered by Terry L. Johnson, CPA on the Company's financial statements; or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement with Rodgers or a reportable event with respect to Rodgers. The Company provided Patrick Rodgers, CPA, PA with an exhibit 16.1 letter to sign but the firm refused to sign the letter. 17 Table of Contents ITEM 9A. CONTROLS A ND PROCEDURES Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) that are designed to be effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance of achieving the desired objectives. Also, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. The design of any system of controls is based, in part, upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our chief executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of December 31, 2014 to cause the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods prescribed by SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our chief executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in internal controls Our Chief Executive Officer performed an evaluation to determine whether any change in our internal controls over financial reporting occurred during the year ended December 31, 2014. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer concluded that no change occurred in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting during the year ended December 31, 2014 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal controls over financial reporting.  Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;  Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our directors; and  Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 18 Table of Contents Our chief executive officer assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control — Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, our chief executive officer believe that, as of December 31, 2014, our internal control over financial reporting is not effective based on those criteria, due to the following: ● Deficiencies in segregation of duties. Lack of proper segregation of functions, duties and responsibilities with respect to our cash and control over the disbursements related thereto due to our very limited staff, including our accounting personnel. ● Deficiencies in the staffing of our financial accounting department. The number of qualified accounting personnel with experience in public company SEC reporting and GAAP is limited. This weakness does not enable us to maintain adequate controls over our financial accounting and reporting processes regarding the accounting for non-routine and non-systematic transactions. There is a risk that a material misstatement of the financial statements could be caused, or at least not be detected in a timely manner, by this shortage of qualified resources . In light of this conclusion and as part of the preparation of this report, we have applied compensating procedures and processes as necessary to ensure the reliability of our financial reporting. Accordingly, management believes, based on its knowledge, that (1) this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material face necessary to make the statements made not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report, and (2) the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the years and periods then ended. This report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to the rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management’s report in this report. There were no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended December 31, 2014, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

It is management's opinion, however, that all material adjustments (consisting of normal and recurring adjustments) have been made which are necessary for a fair financial statements presentation. Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include all of the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary AMD Enterprises, LLC as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 for the periods then ended. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Going Concern The Company has generated limited profits and may experience losses in the near term. We will be dependent on sales of our equity securities and debt financing to meet our cash requirements for the future proposed expansion of operations. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $12,837,124. The Company needs to maintain a steady operating structure, ensuring that expenses are contained such that profits are consistently achieved. In order to expand the Companys business, the Company would likely require additional financing. Management of the Company must continually develop and refine its strategies and goals in order to execute the business plan of the Company on a broad scale and expand the business. Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. Such estimates include managements assessments of the carrying value of certain assets, useful lives of assets, and related depreciation and amortization methods applied. Cash equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. At December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the Company had no cash equivalents. Fair value of financial instruments The Company adopted the provisions of FASB ASC 820 (the Fair Value Topic) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The Fair Value Topic defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. It requires that valuation techniques maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. It also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the valuation inputs into three broad levels. The following fair value hierarchy is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used in order to value the assets and liabilities: A) Market approachUses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. Prices may be indicated by pricing guides, sale transactions, market trades, or other sources; B) Cost approachBased on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement cost); and C) Income approachUses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount based on current market expectations about the future amounts (includes present value techniques, and option-pricing models). Net present value is an income approach where a stream of expected cash flows is discounted at an appropriate market interest rate. Level 1: Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. An active market for an asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with significant frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs. Example of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities and quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. Level 3: Unobservable inputs based on the Companys assessment of the assumptions that are market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The carrying amount of the Companys financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and deferred revenue approximate their fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments. The Companys note payable approximate the fair value of such instruments based upon managements best estimate of interest rates that would be available to the Company for similar financial arrangements at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 and 2012. The Company had no assets and/or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively, using the market and income approaches. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for major additions and betterments are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over the assets estimated useful life of three (3) years for equipment, (5) years for automobile, and (7) years for furniture and fixtures. Upon sale or retirement of property and equipment, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in statements of operations. Impairment of long-lived assets The Company follows paragraph 360-10-05-4 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for its long-lived assets. The Companys long-lived assets, such as intellectual property, are required to be reviewed for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The Company assesses the recoverability of its long-lived assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related long-lived asset or group of long-lived assets over their remaining estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. Fair value is generally determined using the assets expected future discounted cash flows or market value, if readily determinable. If long-lived assets are determined to be recoverable, but the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives are shorter than originally estimated, the net book values of the long-lived assets are depreciated over the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives. The Company determined that there were no impairments of long-lived assets as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013. Commitments and contingencies The Company follows subtopic 450-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report accounting for contingencies. Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. Revenue recognition The Company follows paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition. The Company will recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. In addition, the Company records allowances for accounts receivable that are estimated to not be collected. Stock-Based Compensation In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718, Compensation  Stock Compensation . Under FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718, companies are required to measure the compensation costs of share-based compensation arrangements based on the grant-date fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide services. Share-based compensation arrangements include stock options, restricted share plans, performance-based awards, share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans. As such, compensation cost is measured on the date of grant at their fair value. Such compensation amounts, if any, are amortized over the respective vesting periods of the option grant. The Company applies this statement prospectively. Equity instruments (instruments) issued to other than employees are recorded on the basis of the fair value of the instruments, as required by FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718. FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 505, Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees defines the measurement date and recognition period for such instruments. In general, the measurement date is when either a (a) performance commitment, as defined, is reached or (b) the earlier of (i) the non-employee performance is complete or (ii) the instruments are vested. The measured value related to the instruments is recognized over a period based on the facts and circumstances of each particular grant as defined in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Net income (loss) per share The Company computes basic and diluted earnings per share amounts pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders, by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, excluding the effects of any potentially dilutive securities. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares of common stock during the period. The diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted as of the first day of the year for any potentially diluted debt or equity. There were potentially no dilutive shares outstanding as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013. Subsequent events The Company follows the guidance in Section 855-10-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the disclosure of subsequent events. The Company will evaluate subsequent events through the date when the financial statements were issued. Recently issued accounting pronouncements We have decided to take advantage of the exemptions provided to emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act and as a result our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. We may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, delay compliance with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until they are made applicable to private companies. Company management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements. Reliance on Key Personnel and Consultants The Company is heavily dependent on the continued active participation of their current executive officers, employees and key personnel. The loss of any of the senior management or key employees could significantly and negatively impact the business until adequate replacements can be identified and put in place.

As our reputation for excellent workmanship has grown, we have expanded our operations to serve a larger geographic region. On January 4, 2001, we incorporated in North Dakota as ADM Enterprises, Inc. On May 9, 2006, the Company changed both its name to ADM Endeavors and its domicile to the state of Nevada. On July 1, 2008, the Company acquired all of the assets of ADM Enterprises, LLC, a sole proprietorship owned by Ardell and Tammera Mees, in exchange for 10,000,000 newly issued shares of our common stock. As a result, ADM Enterprises, LLC became a wholly owned subsidiary of Company. Even though the Company was incorporated on January 4, 2001, it had no operations until the share exchange agreement with ADM Enterprises, LLC on July 1, 2008. All business operations are those solely of the Companys wholly owned subsidiary ADM Enterprises, LLC. In May of 2013, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to provide for an increase in its authorized share capital. The authorized common stock increased to 800,000,000 shares at a par value of $0.001 per share and preferred stock increased to 80,000,000 at a par value of $0.001 per share.

It is management's opinion, however, that all material adjustments (consisting of normal and recurring adjustments) have been made which are necessary for a fair financial statements presentation. Principles of Consolidation Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include all of the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary AMD Enterprises, LLC as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 for the periods then ended. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Going Concern Going Concern The Company has generated limited profits and may experience losses in the near term. We will be dependent on sales of our equity securities and debt financing to meet our cash requirements for the future proposed expansion of operations. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $12,837,124. The Company needs to maintain a steady operating structure, ensuring that expenses are contained such that profits are consistently achieved. In order to expand the Companys business, the Company would likely require additional financing. Management of the Company must continually develop and refine its strategies and goals in order to execute the business plan of the Company on a broad scale and expand the business. Use of Estimates Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. Such estimates include managements assessments of the carrying value of certain assets, useful lives of assets, and related depreciation and amortization methods applied. Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. At December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the Company had no cash equivalents. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair value of financial instruments The Company adopted the provisions of FASB ASC 820 (the Fair Value Topic) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The Fair Value Topic defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. It requires that valuation techniques maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. It also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the valuation inputs into three broad levels. The following fair value hierarchy is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used in order to value the assets and liabilities: A) Market approachUses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. Prices may be indicated by pricing guides, sale transactions, market trades, or other sources; B) Cost approachBased on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement cost); and C) Income approachUses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount based on current market expectations about the future amounts (includes present value techniques, and option-pricing models). Net present value is an income approach where a stream of expected cash flows is discounted at an appropriate market interest rate. Level 1: Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. An active market for an asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with significant frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs. Example of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities and quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. Level 3: Unobservable inputs based on the Companys assessment of the assumptions that are market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The carrying amount of the Companys financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and deferred revenue approximate their fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments. The Companys note payable approximate the fair value of such instruments based upon managements best estimate of interest rates that would be available to the Company for similar financial arrangements at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 and 2012. The Company had no assets and/or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively, using the market and income approaches. Property and Equipment Property and Equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for major additions and betterments are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over the assets estimated useful life of three (3) years for equipment, (5) years for automobile, and (7) years for furniture and fixtures. Upon sale or retirement of property and equipment, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in statements of operations. Impairment of Long-lived Assets Impairment of long-lived assets The Company follows paragraph 360-10-05-4 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for its long-lived assets. The Companys long-lived assets, such as intellectual property, are required to be reviewed for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The Company assesses the recoverability of its long-lived assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related long-lived asset or group of long-lived assets over their remaining estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. Fair value is generally determined using the assets expected future discounted cash flows or market value, if readily determinable. If long-lived assets are determined to be recoverable, but the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives are shorter than originally estimated, the net book values of the long-lived assets are depreciated over the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives. The Company determined that there were no impairments of long-lived assets as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013. Commitments and Contingencies Commitments and contingencies The Company follows subtopic 450-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report accounting for contingencies. Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. Revenue Recognition Revenue recognition The Company follows paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition. The Company will recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. In addition, the Company records allowances for accounts receivable that are estimated to not be collected. Stock-based Compensation Stock-Based Compensation In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718, Compensation  Stock Compensation . Under FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718, companies are required to measure the compensation costs of share-based compensation arrangements based on the grant-date fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide services. Share-based compensation arrangements include stock options, restricted share plans, performance-based awards, share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans. As such, compensation cost is measured on the date of grant at their fair value. Such compensation amounts, if any, are amortized over the respective vesting periods of the option grant. The Company applies this statement prospectively. Equity instruments (instruments) issued to other than employees are recorded on the basis of the fair value of the instruments, as required by FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718. FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 505, Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees defines the measurement date and recognition period for such instruments. In general, the measurement date is when either a (a) performance commitment, as defined, is reached or (b) the earlier of (i) the non-employee performance is complete or (ii) the instruments are vested. The measured value related to the instruments is recognized over a period based on the facts and circumstances of each particular grant as defined in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Net Income (loss) Per Share Net income (loss) per share The Company computes basic and diluted earnings per share amounts pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders, by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, excluding the effects of any potentially dilutive securities. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares of common stock during the period. The diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted as of the first day of the year for any potentially diluted debt or equity. There were potentially no dilutive shares outstanding as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013. Subsequent Events Subsequent events The Company follows the guidance in Section 855-10-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the disclosure of subsequent events. The Company will evaluate subsequent events through the date when the financial statements were issued. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Recently issued accounting pronouncements We have decided to take advantage of the exemptions provided to emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act and as a result our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. We may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, delay compliance with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until they are made applicable to private companies. Company management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements. Reliance On Key Personnel and Consultants Reliance on Key Personnel and Consultants The Company is heavily dependent on the continued active participation of their current executive officers, employees and key personnel.

In May of 2013, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to provide for an increase in its authorized share capital. The authorized common stock increased to 800,000,000 shares at a par value of $0.001 per share and preferred stock increased to 80,000,000 at a par value of $0.001 per share. On June 5, 2013, the Company designated 80,000,000 preferred shares as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock which has the voting power equal to 100 common shares per each share of preferred stock. Each Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into 10 common shares at any time by the holder. Preferred shares issued On June 10, 2013, the Company issued 20,000,000 Series A Convertible Preferred Shares to its CEO, Ardell Mees, for executive services performed on behalf of the Company. On September 20, 2013, the Company canceled the 20,000,000 preferred shares to Ardell Mees. The Board of Directors believes it is in the Companys best interest to cancel the 20,000,000 preferred shares because they would substantially dilute the market value of the Companys stock if converted to common shares. Common shares issued On June 7, 2013, the Company issued 2,250,000 shares to a Calvin Mees, a related party consultant, for various services performed which include the development of a business plan for the expansion of the Companys operations, preparation of news releases, investor affairs, and other business related services. The shares were valued at $0.001 per share which resulted in the Company recording a consulting expense of $2,250. The consulting services provided were completed by June 30, 2013. The consultant is a related party to the Company as he is the brother of Ardell, Mees, the Companys CEO. The Company has had no recent sales of stock for cash nor has the Company had an independent valuation of the Companys stock price. Therefore, management valued the shares at par value $0.001. The Company did not issue any new shares of common stock in the year ended December 31, 2014.
