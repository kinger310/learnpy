“Company”) was incorporated in the state of Nevada on October 23, 2008 under the name Ukragro Corporation. The Company’s
principal activity is manufacturing and is located near Bellingham WA, USA. The Company manufactures consumer and corporate products
using an additive manufacturing method through 3D Metal printing technology and conventional precision manufacturing processes. On January 29, 2010, the
Company filed an amendment to its articles of incorporation changing its name to Amarok Resources, Inc. In the same amendment,
the Company changed its authorized capital to 175,000,000 shares of common stock at a restated par value of $.001. On November 18, 2013, the
Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation (the “Amendment”) with the Secretary of State
of Nevada. As a result of the Amendment, the Company (1) has changed its name with the State of Nevada from Amarok Resources,
Inc. to 3DX Industries, Inc. and (2) increased its authorized capital to 185,000,000 shares, consisting of 175,000,000 shares of
Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share. The Company’s
name change was declared effective by FINRA on November 22, 2013. Additionally, the Company changed its symbol from “AMOK”
to “DDDX;” the symbol change was declared effective by FINRA on December 23, 2013. In addition, the Company’s
Board of Directors authorized a 50:1 reverse stock split. All references to shares outstanding in this filing have been restated
to reflect the indicated reverse stock split. Business Summary 3DX Industries, Inc. is
a public company trading on the OTCQB market under the symbol DDDX. The Company was previously traded under the symbol “AMOK”
and was engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties on an international scale for future commercial
development and production. The Company focused primarily on projects with Gold, Silver and base metal potential. Due to a downturn
in the resource and exploration sector, the Company decided that a new business focus would be beneficial and changed its name
to 3DX Industries, Inc., effective November 22, 2013. 3DX Industries, Inc.’s new business focus is in the manufacturing sector
through additive manufacturing and precision machining including 3D Metal printing. On December 18, 2013, the Company entered into
an Equipment Purchase Agreement with Roger Janssen pursuant to which the Company purchased certain assets of Key Manufacturing
(Key), a precision manufacturing company with over 30 years in the industry. As of October 31, 2014, the Company has not yet generated
revenues from operations. The Company’s manufacturing
services will include additive manufacturing through its 3D Metal Printing and Composite Printing Systems, and more traditional
manufacturing methods using CNC precision machining processes. 3DX uses a binder jet additive manufacturing system for 3D Metal
printing. The 3D Metal printing process materializes an object—or mold for an object—layer by layer out of powdered
material, a chemical binder and a digital file. The process of metal printing allows for the creation, or materialization of Complex
internal geometries, undercuts, angled passages and multi-piece assemblies with accuracy and less waste/environmental impact. The
3D Printing Process is highly accurate and capable of printing complex geometric parts. 3 The Company uses a Composite
printing system for its plastic parts and for some initial prototype work to give clients the look and feel of the finished part
or object prior to final production. 3DX also has a fully operational CNC machine shop in house consisting of fifteen various CNC
machining centers including four fanuc robo-drills and numerous additional support equipment. Having a precision machining center
under the same roof as our additive manufacturing systems allows for the complete one stop shop advantage we offer to our customers.
3DX will continually seek to expand the range of size and geometric complexity of the parts we can make using these processes The
Company will continue to expand the variety of materials we are able to support and to identify additional manufacturing processes
to which we can apply using the latest technology in order to better serve our client base. We have the ability to
serve product developers worldwide who bring new ideas to market in the form of products, industrial and consumer, containing one
or more custom parts and components. Many of these product developers use 3D CAD software to create digital models representing
their custom part designs that are then used to create physical parts for prototyping, functional testing, market evaluation and/or
production. Custom prototype parts play a critical role in the product development process, as they provide product developers
with the ability to confirm their intended performance requirements and explore design alternatives. Additive manufacturing
processes such as 3D Metal Printing and 3D Composite Printing can be used to quickly and efficiently produce a physical representation
of a part or product. As technology in this area continues to evolve these parts are becoming more accurate and in many instances
are able to meet the product developers’ requirements for dimensional accuracy, cosmetics and material properties. There
are instances where the use of more traditional manufacturing processes is required such as CNC Precision machining, in order to
finalize the proto-type or production part. As a supplement to additive manufacturing, our CNC machining facility can be used to
produce extreme precision, high-quality custom parts in metal or plastic. Initial functional testing, market evaluation and production
run tests are typically manufactured using our 3D Composite Printing System. With the advancement of technology in the additive
manufacturing arena, 3D Metal Printing and Composite Printing can yield a part with the look, feel and performance of the finished
product. The ability to meet our
clients’ needs both in the additive manufacturing sector and in the traditional precision machining arena will make 3DX Industries
a leader in the manufacturing market. Having both processes in house is a significant time and cost saving advantage for 3DX’s
clients and will allow 3DX to integrate seamlessly into the metal printing market. 3DX is in a position to provide 3D Metal Printing,
3D Composite Printing, Precision Tooling, 3D Rapid Proto-Typing, CNC Milling, Large Capacity Milling and Injection Mold Tooling. Competition We
compete in a marketplace that is still primarily using conventional methods of product-making and prototype development and the
market is currently limited to major manufacturing corporations mainly for in house product development. Our Company focus
is on the design and manufacture of industrial and consumer products using both 3D metal printing technology and conventional precision
machining. This is a massive market covering a range of industries from aviation, automotive, military and medical to consumer
products, such as Jewelry and Fashion, as well as technology proto-type products and equipment. Using 3D metal printing technology,
3DX will have the capability to provide products and services to anyone requiring a manufactured part. We
believe that we have competitive strengths that position us favorably and will enable us to become a leader in our markets. We
also believe that currently there are few “ job shop ” type manufacturers such as 3DX, capable of offering precision
machining services, 3D Metal printing and 3D Composite printing. Having all of these manufacturing process’s under one roof,
and the expertise to integrate these process’s we believe is an advantage to our customers and sets us apart from many of
our competitors. However, our industry is evolving rapidly and other companies, including potentially larger and more established
companies with developed technological capabilities, may begin to focus on our market. As reported by Grand View Research, “some
key industry participants include Stratasys Inc., 3D Systems Corporation, Envisiontec GmbH, and Materialise NV. Intensifying competition
is expected to result in lowered prices and increased shipments in the 3D printing market in the coming years. With products maturing
rapidly, and iteratively enhancing technology reducing the gap between objects made using this form of printing and conventional
methods, the market is expected to witness growing demand” through 2020. See generally Grand View Research, 3D Printing
Market Analysis By Application (Automotive, Aerospace, Medical), By Raw Material (Polymers, Metals, Ceramic) And Segment Forecasts
To 2020, published December 2013. These companies could more directly compete with us, along with our existing competitors,
and both could also launch new products and services that we do not offer that may quickly gain market acceptance. Any of the foregoing
could adversely affect our ability to attract customers. 4 Industry Trends 3D Metal Printing is quickly
becoming known throughout the manufacturing industry as “cutting edge” as 3D printers can manufacture everything from
toys to automotive parts. Not to be confused with 3D Plastic Printing, which has been around for some time, 3D Metal printing is
a new and innovative method that will change the way products are currently manufactured. Manufacturing can be described
as either additive or subtractive. Subtractive manufacturing, which includes milling and lathing, is comparable to sculpting wherein
a manufacturer starts with a block of metal which is chipped and shaved away until a statue or engine part emerges. In comparison,
additive manufacturing is conducted through the successive layering of materials, without the intervention of cutting, drilling,
etc., which come together in order to make one metal piece. Additive manufacturing is a more efficient process that can be used
to create designs that cannot be made using traditional techniques. This technology differs from mass production, which results
in a large volume of identical parts at low cost. While the majority of the items produced using this process have been mock-ups
and prototypes, producers are migrating towards manufacturing low-volume products to be used across various industries. The foremost
advantage of this technology is the production of spare parts which cannot be easily obtained otherwise. 3D printing helps in the
production of reliable products and lowers the need for iterative product development, thus decreasing the time-to-market of new
products. Furthermore, the process alleviates the wastage of raw material as in the case of machining, since only the amount of
material necessary for the part under printing is used.Although these techniques are in the process of change, much of manufacturing
today still falls in the subtractive category. Government Regulation We

Company entered into an agreement with Carlin Gold Resources, Inc., (“Carlin”) in which Carlin assigned the Company
all of its rights, title, and interest in an exploration agreement between it and Trio. The assigned exploration agreement was
dated January 28, 2010. On March 23, 2012, the Company and Trio entered into an agreement that modified certain terms of the original
Agreement (the “Modified Agreement”). During the earn-in-period, the Company is to provide $5,500,000 in funding to
cover operational costs. Under the original Agreement, $1,500,000 was to be funded during the 2010 budget year, $2,000,000 was
to be funded during the 2011 budget year and $2,000,000 was to be funded during the 2012 budget year. The Modified Agreement eliminates
the annual funding requirements and extends the due date of the $5,500,000 funding to December 31, 2013. Under the original Agreement,
the Company was required to pay a minimum annual royalty during the earn-in period to Trio of which $75,000 was paid upon signing
of the Agreement, $100,000 was paid on April 1, 2011 and $150,000 was to be paid on April 1, 2012. Under the Modified Agreement,
the $150,000 payment due April 1, 2012 has been deferred and will be due and payable on or before April 1, 2013 and will be applied
against the $5,500,000 funding. In consideration for modifying the terms of the original Agreement and extending the due date,
the Company issued Trio 2,788 restated shares of its common shares valued at $11,152, which was charged to operations and included
in exploratory costs. In addition, pursuant to
the original agreement the Company is required to issue Trio shares of its common stock equaling 0.20% of its total issued and
outstanding as of February 22, 2010. Upon expenditure of a minimum of $2,000,000 on the claims, Trio shall receive an additional
0.10% of the Company’s issued and outstanding common shares. Upon expending a minimum of $4,000,000 on the claims, Trio shall
receive an additional 0.10% of the Company’s issued and outstanding common shares. Upon expenditure of $5,500,000 on the
claims, Trio shall receive a final 0.10% of the Company’s issued and outstanding common shares. All shares issued shall be
restricted common shares and will be stamped with the applicable hold period. On February 22, 2010, the Company issued 2,884 restated
shares of its common stock to Trio valued at $242,323, based upon the trading price of the shares on the date of issuance. On October
25, 2011, the Company issued 1,442 shares of its common stock to Trio valued at $5,769, based upon the trading price of the shares
on the date of issuance. On March 23, 2012, the Company issued 2,788 restated shares of its common stock to Trio valued at $11,152,
based upon the trading price of the shares on the date of issuance. The values of the shares have been charged to operations and
included in exploration costs. Once the Company has provided
$5,500,000 in funding for the project, the Company and Trio shall fund the operational costs jointly, with the Company providing
75% of the funds and Trio providing 25% of the funds. As of the date of this annual report, the Company funded a total of $2,400,000
in the property’s operational costs as defined under the Modified Agreement. The funds paid have been charged to operations
and included in exploratory costs. As it continues to be difficult to raise funds for exploration projects at this time, management
is reviewing its commitment to Rodeo Creek and will be reviewing its options relating to continued involvement in this project. On February 13, 2013, the
Company entered into an agreement with Trio to modify the terms of the above indicated final minimum royalty payment of $150,000,
which was due on April 1, 2013. In exchange for paying $15,000 upon the signing of the agreement and $5,000 on August 1, 2013,
the due date of the remaining $130,000 is extended to October 1, 2013, with the date when the full $5,500,000 must be spent on
the Rodeo Claims is extended to December 31, 2014. Of the $20,000 that is due, $15,000 was paid on February 20, 2013 and $5,000
was paid on March 15, 2013. The $20,000 was charged to exploratory costs. The Company failed to pay
the required $130,000 that was due on October 1, 2013 and is in default under the agreement.. In December 2014, the Company
notified Trio of its intent to terminate its agreement on the Rodeo Creek Property. The Company will have no further interest in
this project. The Company has earned a 2% Net Smelter Royalty on the property and has granted Trio the exclusive right and option
at any time to buy back 100% of the Royalty by paying to the Company a cash consideration of $3,000,000.00 (USD) (the “Buy
Back Option”). The Buy Back Option may be exercised at any time in part by Trio paying $1,500,000.00 (USD) for each one percent
(1%) of the Royalty purchased by Trio. McNeil Claims, Canada The McNeil property is
located within the Abitibi Greenstone belt, approximately 30 miles southeast of Timmins, Ontario, Canada and approximately 35 miles
west of Kirkland Lake, Ontario, Canada. On October 8, 2013, the Company entered into an agreement with Trio Gold Corp. to assign
all of its claims to Trio subject to it spending a total of CDN $5mm on or before December 31, 2018. The agreement calls for an
exploration expenditure of CDN $500,000 on or before December 31, 2015, a further CDN $2.0mm on or before December 31, 2017 and
a final CDN $2.5mm on or before December 31, 2019. Once the $5mm is expended, the claims will be assigned to Trio, and in exchange,
Trio will grant the Company a 5% Net Smelter Return on production. The NSR can be purchased from the Company by Trio for a total
of CDN $2mm per each 1%, totaling CDN $10mm Night Hawk Property The
Company had staked 35 claims on property adjacent to the McNeil known as the Night Hawk Property. The Night Hawk Claims border the McNeil claims to the west and consist of approximately 17,350 acres. The Company did not have
sufficient funds to pay the fees required to renew the 35 claims and on October 8, 2013 it assigned its total interest in these
claims to Trio in exchange for a 5% royalty on the net smelter returns generated from these claims. The Company granted Trio the
option to purchase each 1% royalty interest for $2,000,000(CND). Trio was unable to raise sufficient funds for the development
and required fee payments on the claims by November 2014 and as a result Trio has forfeited the claims resulting in a termination
of the royalty option. The Company no longer has any interest in the claims. 6 Cueva Blanca Gold
Property On April 16, 2010, the
Company entered into an agreement with St. Elias Mines Ltd. (“St. Elias”) in which the Company was given an option
to earn a 60% interest, subject to a 1.5% net smelter royalty (“NSR”) in the Cueva Blanca gold property (1,200 hectares)
in Northern Peru, which is wholly owned by St. Elias. Under the terms of the letter agreement, it is possible for the Company to
acquire a 60% interest in the Property (subject to a 1.5% NSR) in consideration of: (a) making cash payments of $200,000
to St. Elias over a two-year period; (b) issuing 100,000 common shares
in the capital of Amarok to St. Elias; and (c) incurring at least $1,500,000
in exploration expenditures on the property over a three-year period. In addition, the Company
shall have the right to purchase one-half of the 1.5% NSR from St. Elias for the sum of $1,500,000, thereby reducing the NSR payable
to from 1.5% to 0.75%. The Company’s first
payment of $10,000 was paid on June 24, 2010. On April 27, 2011, the agreement between St. Elias and Amarok was formally terminated
by St. Elias. As of January 31, 2012, the Company paid a total of $27,603 in fees towards property maintenance costs on the Cueva
Blanca property. The company has no further
interest in this project. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We know of no material,
existing or pending legal proceedings against our company, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending
litigation. There are no proceedings in which our director, officer or any affiliates, or any registered or beneficial shareholder,
is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not Applicable. PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS MARKET INFORMATION Our common stock has been
quoted on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board (OTCQB) since March 6, 2009 under the symbol “UKRA”. Subsequently, the
Company changed its name to Amarok Resources and was quoted under the symbol “AMOK” from February 23, 2010 until December
23, 2013. On November 22, 2013, the Company’s name change from Amarok Resources, Inc. to 3DX Industries, Inc. became effective.
Subsequently on December 23, 2013, the Company’s symbol changed from “AMOK” to “DDDX”. Because we
are quoted on the OTCQB Bulletin Board, our common stock may be less liquid, receive less coverage by security analysts and news
media, and generate lower prices than might otherwise be obtained if it were listed on a national securities exchange. The following table sets
forth, for the fiscal quarters indicated, the high and low sales prices per share of our common stock, as derived from quotations

common stock approved a One (1) for Fifty (50) reverse stock split of its $0.001 par value common stock (the “Reverse Split”).

options, warrants and rights to purchase common stock as of the Effective Date were also subject to the adjustment and were decreased
accordingly. Other than the foregoing,
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock nor do we anticipate paying any in the foreseeable future.
Furthermore, we expect to retain any future earnings to finance our operations and expansion. The payment of cash dividends in
the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our earnings levels, capital requirements,
any restrictive loan covenants and other factors the Board considers relevant. Securities Authorized for Issuance Under

company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this
item. ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONA ND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This Annual Report on
Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
“Securities Act”) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
These forward-looking statements are not historical facts but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections.
We may use words such as “anticipate,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,”
“foresee,” “estimate” and variations of these words and similar expressions to identify forward-looking
statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other
factors, some of which are beyond our control, are difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from
those expressed or forecasted. You should read this report completely and with the understanding that actual future results may
be materially different from what we expect. The forward looking statements included in this report are made as of the date of
this report and should be evaluated with consideration of any changes occurring after the date of this Report. We will not update
forward-looking statements even though our situation may change in the future and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Plan of Operation As of October 31, 2014,
we had $2,074 of cash on hand. We incurred operating expenses in the amount of $6,125,471 during the year ended October 31, 2014,
of which $4,800,000 was stock-based compensation. These operating expenses were comprised of general and administrative expenses,
professional fees, directors’ and consulting fees, impairment losses and other miscellaneous expenses. The
Company is in the early stage of operations and has not yet generated any revenues. Management cannot guarantee that
the Company will be successful in its business operations and the Company’s business is subject to risks inherent in the
establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns. Our current
cash holdings will not satisfy our liquidity requirements and we will require additional financing to pursue our planned business
activities. We are in the process of seeking equity and or debt financing to fund our operations over the next 12 months; however,
management provides no assurance that future financing will be available to the Company on acceptable terms. If financing
is not available on satisfactory terms, the Company may be unable to continue, develop, or expand its operations. Equity
financing could result in additional dilution to the Company’s existing shareholders. Revenues The Company
did not generate any revenues during the years ended October 31, 2014 and 2013. 8 Expenses For the year
ended October 31, 2014, total operating expenses were $6,125,471 as compared to $436,272 for the year ended October 31, 2013.
This is a 1,304% increase in operating expenses for 2014 compared to 2013 and can be attributed to 1) a one-time impairment loss
on our mining properties of $689,710; 2) an increase in officer’s compensation of $4,925,200 ($0 in 2013 compared to $4,925,200
in 2014; previously officers were compensated via management fees paid to a related company; management fees were $11,000 in 2014,
compared to $328,077 in 2013); 3) an increase in research and development of $186,514 ($0
in 2013 compared to $186,514 in 2014), and ;
an increase in general and administrative expenses of $185,702 ($18,641 in 2013 compared to $204,316 in 2014). Working Capital October 31, 2014 October 31, 2013 Difference Current Assets $ 3,688 $ 3,660 $ (28 ) Current Liabilities $ 1,087,603 $ 465,421 $ (622,182 ) Working Capital $ (1,083,915 ) $ (461,761 ) $ (622,154 ) Cash Flows Year Ended October 31, 2014 Year Ended October 31, 2013 Net Cash (Used) in Operating Activities $ (288,246 ) $ (95,164 ) Net Cash (Used) in Investing Activities $ (102,630 ) $ — Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities $ 390,490 $ 78,800 Net Effect of Foreign Currency Translation $ — $ — Net (Decrease) in Cash During the Period $ (386 ) $ (16,364 ) Interest
Expense Interest
expense for the year ended October 31, 2014 totaled $(50,486) and mainly consisted of interest accruing on certain outstanding
accounts and notes payable. Interest expense for the twelve months ended October 31,
2013 was $(10,276). Liquidity and Capital Resources Growth of our operations
will be based on our ability to internally finance from operating cash flows, and the ability to raise funds through equity and/or
debt financing to increase sales and production. Our primary sources of liquidity are: (i) investor loans; and (ii) financing activities.
Our cash balance as of October 31, 2014 is $2,074. Our Company has funded
some of its operations through debt financing with related and non-related party transactions, The
Company is not aware of any known trends, events or uncertainties which may affect its future liquidity. 9 Critical Accounting Policies Our financial statements
and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on
a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
periods. We regularly evaluate the
accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare for financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included
in the notes to our financial statements. In general, management’s estimates are based on historical experience, on information
from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances.
Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management. Going Concern For the year ended October
31, 2014, our Company had a working capital deficit of $1,083,985. We have not attained profitable operations and are dependent
upon obtaining financing to pursue any extensive activities. For these reasons, our auditors stated in their report on our audited
financial statements that they have substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern without further financing. Future Financing We will continue to rely
on equity sales of our common shares in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will
result in dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of the equity securities
or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our business and ongoing operations. Inflation The amounts presented in
the financial statements do not provide for the effect of inflation on our operations or financial position. The net operating
losses shown would be greater than reported if the effects of inflation were reflected either by charging operations with amounts
that represent replacement costs or by using other inflation adjustments. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of October 31, 2014,
we had no off-balance sheet transactions that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or
capital resources that are material to stockholders. 10 Contractual Obligations We are a smaller reporting
company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this
item. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements On June 10, 2014, FASB
issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities . The update removes the definition of a development
stage entity from FASB ASC 915 and eliminates the requirement for development stage entities to present inception-to-date information
on the statements of operations, cash flows and stockholders’ deficit. The Company early adopted this standard for the period
covered by the report herein. Other than as noted above
the Company has not implemented any pronouncements that had material impact on the financial statements and the Company does not
believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial
position or results of operations. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are a smaller reporting

and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have,
nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances,
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of October 31, 2014, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming
that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company suffered losses
from operations and has a working capital deficiency, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.
Management’s plans regarding those matters also are described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. MaloneBailey, LLP www.malonebailey.com Houston, Texas February 13, 2015 F- 1 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING

The Company recognized a loss on the extinguishment of the debt in the amount of $4,099,200 that was charged to operations. On June 20, 2014, the holder of the $175,000 of convertible accrued compensation assigned $1,000 of the amount due to a third party. On June 26, 2014, the above indicated assignee converted $1,000 of accrued compensation due in exchange for $1,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock at the conversion price of $.001 per share. No gain or loss was recognized on the conversion and issuance of the common shares. In November 2013, the Company settled with the landlord of the office it was renting in Rancho Margarita, California for $4,010. The Company recognized a gain on the settlement in the amount of $1,793. Pursuant to the terms of Mr. Janssen's executive employment agreement the Company issue him 30,000,000 shares of its common stock valued at $4,800,000, which was charged to operations. On December 18, 2013, the Company acquired various equipment relating to its 3D metal imaging business from R Janssen, the Company's President, for $500,000. The $500,000 is evidenced by a promissory note which is assessed interest at an annual rate of 1.64%. Accrued interest is payable quarterly with the principal and an accrued unpaid interest fully due and payable on December 15, 2018. On December 23, 2013, the Company purchased manufacturing equipment relating to its 3D metal imaging business from an unrelated third party. The total purchase price is $750,000 of which $75,000 was paid upon delivery. The remaining balance of $675,000 is payable in two equal installments of $337,500. The first installment is due June 1, 2014 and the second installment is due September 1, 2014. The terms of the installment payments do not include a stated interest rate, therefore, the Company accounted for the purchase pursuant to ASC Topic 835-30-25, "Imputation of Interest" (see Note 5). On January 15, 2013, the Company granted Santeo Financial Corp ("Santeo") the option to convert 25% of accrued management fees of $175,000 owed to Santeo at a conversion rate of $0.001 per share and the option to convert the remaining 75% of accrued management fees at a conversion rate of $0.01 per share. The conversion feature was accounted for under ASC Topic 470-20 and the discount of the beneficial conversion feature of $148,077 was immediately charged to operations pursuant to ASC Topic 470-20-35. The Accompanying notes are an integral
part to the financials F- 6 3DX Industries, Inc. (Formerly Amarok Resources, Inc.) (An Exploratory Stage Company) Notes to the Financial Statements NOTE 1 -
ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION Amarok Resources, Inc. (“Amarok”
or the “Company”) was incorporated in the state of Nevada on October 23, 2008 under the name Ukragro Corporation. The
Company’s principal activity is the exploration and development of mineral properties for future commercial development and
production. On September 26, 2013, the Company filed an
amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation and changed the Company’s name from Amarok Resources, Inc. to
3DX Industries, Inc. and increased the number of shares authorized to 185,000,000 of which 175,000,000 have been designated common
shares and 10,000,000 have been designated preferred shares. Also on September 26, 2013, the Company authorized a 50:1 reverse
stock split. The accompanying financial statements have been restated to reflect the change in capital and stock split as if they
occurred at the Company’s inception. Going Concern The Company has
incurred net losses since inception, and as of October 31, 2014 had a combined accumulated deficit of $16,055,373 and had negative
working capital of $1,083,915 . These
conditions raise substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not
include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. These financial statements do not include any adjustments
relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that
might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Management recognizes that the Company must
generate additional funds to enable it to continue operating. Management intends to raise additional financing through debt and
or equity financing and by other means that it deems necessary, with the goal of moving forward and sustaining a prolonged growth
in its strategy phases. However, no assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in raising additional capital. Further,
even if the company raises additional capital, there can be no assurance that the Company will achieve profitability or positive
cash flow. If management is unable to raise additional capital and expected significant revenues do not result in positive cash
flow, the Company will not be able to meet its obligations and may have to cease operations. NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid debt
instruments and other short-term investments with a maturity date of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents. Mining Costs Costs incurred to purchase, lease or otherwise
acquire property are capitalized when incurred. General exploration costs and costs to maintain rights and leases are expensed
as incurred. Management periodically reviews the recoverability of the capitalized mineral properties. Management takes into consideration
various information including, but not limited to, historical production records taken from previous mining operations, results
of exploration activities conducted to date, estimated future prices and reports and opinions of outside consultants. When it is
determined that a project or property will be abandoned or its carrying value has been impaired, a provision is made for any expected
loss on the project or property. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost.
Major renewals and improvements are charged to the asset accounts while replacements, maintenance and repairs that do not improve
or extend the lives of the respective assets are expensed. At the time property and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed
of, the asset and related accumulated depreciation accounts are relieved of the applicable amounts. Gains or losses from retirements
or sales are credited or charged to income. In June 2014, the Company commenced testing
its equipment and began producing prototypes. Depreciation expense classified to operations for the year ended October 31 2014
and 2013 amounted $75,585 and $0, respectively. Long-Lived Assets The Company accounts for its long-lived assets
in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 360-10-05, “Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” ASC Topic 360-10-05 requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the historical cost carrying value of an asset may no longer be appropriate. The
Company assesses recoverability of the carrying value of an asset by estimating the future net cash flows expected to result from
the asset, including eventual disposition. If the future net cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment
loss is recorded equal to the difference between the asset’s carrying value and fair value or disposable value. The Company
determined that the carrying cost of its mining properties were fully impaired and for the year ended October 31, 2014, the Company
charged $689,710 to impairment loss. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Pursuant to ASC No. 820, “ Fair
Value Measurements and Disclosures, ” the Company is required to estimate the fair value of all financial instruments
included on its balance sheet as of October 31, 2014. The Company’s financial instruments consist of accounts payables and
notes and loans payable. The Company considers the carrying value of such amounts in the financial statements to approximate their
fair value due to the short-term nature of the respective instrument. Loss Per Share of Common Stock The Company follows Accounting Standard Codification
Topic No. 260, “Earnings Per Share” (“ASC No. 260”) that requires the reporting of both basic and diluted
earnings (loss) per share. Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The calculation of diluted earnings (loss) per share
reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted
into common stock. In accordance with ASC No. 260, any anti-dilutive effects on net earnings (loss) per share are excluded. Potential
common shares at October 31, 2014 that have been excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share include an option
to convert approximately $4,117 in fees due Santeo Financial Corporation at October 31, 2014 into 4,117,060 common shares. Potential
common shares at October 31, 2013 that have been excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share include an option
to convert approximately $174 in fees due Santeo Financial Corporation at October 31, 2013 into 173,762 common shares Convertible Debt Instruments If the conversion features of conventional
debt instruments provides for a rate of conversion that is below market value at issuance, this feature is characterized as a
beneficial conversion feature (“BCF”). A BCF is recorded by the Company as a debt discount pursuant to ASC Topic 470-20
“Debt with Conversion and Other Options.” In those circumstances, the convertible debt is recorded net of the discount
related to the BCF, and the Company amortizes the discount to operations over the life of the debt using the effective interest
method. The Company was not required to record any BCF’s on any of the convertible debt it issued during the years ended
October 31, 2014 and 2013. F- 7 Issuances Involving Non-Cash Consideration All issuances of the Company’s
stock for non-cash consideration have been assigned a dollar amount equaling the market value of the shares issued on the date
the shares were issued for such services. The non-cash consideration received pertains to officer’s compensation and consulting
services. Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for stock-based
compensation under Accounting Standard Codification Topic 505-50, “Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees.” This topic
defines a fair-value-based method of accounting for stock-based compensation. In accordance with the Topic, the cost of stock-based
compensation is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized over the vesting period. The value
of the stock-based award is determined using Binomial or Black-Scholes option-pricing models, whereby compensation cost is the
excess of the fair value of the award as determined by the pricing model at the grant date or other measurement date over the amount
that must be paid to acquire the stock. The resulting amount is charged to expense on the straight-line basis over the period in
which the Company expects to receive the benefit, which is generally the vesting period. Development Stage On June 10, 2014, FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities. The update removes the definition of a development stage entity from
FASB ASC 915 and eliminates the requirement for development stage entities to present inception-to-date information on the statements
of operations, cash flows and stockholders’ deficit. The Company adopted this standard for the period covered by the report
herein. Reclassification Certain reclassifications have been made to
conform the 2013 amounts to 2014 classifications for comparative purposes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements The Company’s
management has evaluated all recent accounting p ronouncements since the last audit through
the issuance date of these financial statements. In the Company’s opinion, none of the recent accounting p ronouncements will have a material effect on the financial statements. NOTE 3 -
MINING CLAIMS McNeil Claims, Canada On March 24, 2011 the
Company signed an agreement with Warrior Ventures, Inc. (“Warrior”), a private company, to acquire 100% of the McNeil
Gold Property. The McNeil property is located within the Abitibi Greenstone belt, approximately 30 miles southeast of Timmins,
Ontario, Canada and approximately 35 miles west of Kirkland Lake, Ontario, Canada. The purchase price of the property was in exchange
for Warrior receiving 28,000 shares of the Company’s restricted common stock along with an option to purchase 28,000 of the
Company common shares of the Company at a price of $1.00 per common share until October 1, 2011. Any options remaining unexercised
as of September 1, 2011 may be exercised at a price of $1.25 per common share until March 31, 2012, after which the option to purchase
any shares of Amarok automatically terminates. The Company initially valued the 28,000 shares at $784,000 based upon the trading
price of the common shares on the date of issuance. The Company valued the 28,000 options at $98,724 using a binomial option model
with a trading price of $0.56 per share, risk-free interest rate of 0.26%, and volatility of 93.221%. The total of $882,724 was
capitalized as mining properties. At October 31, 2011, the Company recognized an impairment of $322,000 on the reduction in the
fair value of mining claim based upon the agreed upon price of $0.33 per share pursuant to the underlying purchase agreement. The
$0.33 per share was based upon the trading price of the Company’s common share on the March 23, 2011. Through October 31,
2013, the Company has incurred additional acquisition costs totaling $91,606. The capitalized costs of the McNeil claim as of October
31, 2013 amounted to $652,330. On October 8, 2013, the
Company entered into an agreement with Trio Gold Corp. (“Trio”) to assign 100% of its claims in the McNeil property,
subject to a 5% net smelter royalty, to Trio once Trio has incurred exploration and administrative costs totaling $5,000,000 (CND)
based upon the following schedule: On or before December
31, 2015	$ 500,000 On or before December
31, 2017	$2,000,000 On or before December
31, 2019	$2,500,000 F- 8 Nighthawk Claims, Canada The Company had staked 35 claims on property
adjacent to the McNeil known as the Night Hawk Property. The acquisition cost associated with this claims totaled $37,380. The
Company did not have sufficient funds to pay the fees required to renew the 35 claims and on October 8, 2013 it assigned its total
interest in these claims to Trio in exchange for a 5% royalty on the net smelter returns generated from these claims. The Company
granted Trio the option to purchase each 1% royalty interest for $2,000,000 (CND). The Company did not report any gain or loss
on this transaction and valued the 5% net royalty interest at the property’s current acquisition cost of $37,380. Trio was
unable to raise sufficient funds for the development and required fee payments on the claims by November 2014 and as a result Trio
has forfeited the claims resulting in a termination of the royalty option. The Company no longer has any interest in the claims. Rodeo Creek Project, Nevada On February 22, 2010, the Company entered into
an agreement with Carlin Gold Resources, Inc., (“Carlin”) in which Carlin assigned the Company all of its rights, title,
and interest in an exploration agreement between it and Trio. The assigned exploration agreement was dated January 28, 2010. In
consideration for the assignment of the interest in the exploration agreement, the Company paid Carlin $1 and issued 2,000 shares
of its common stock, valued at $168,000 based upon the trading price of the shares on the date of issuance. The value of these
shares has been charged to operations and included in exploration costs. Trio has leased and has an option to purchase
a 100% interest in 29 unpatented lode mining claims located in Nevada within the Carlin Gold Trend (the “Claims”).
The Claims are subject to a 1.5% net smelter return (“NSR”). Under the terms of the original agreement,
the Company earns a 75% undivided interest in the Property during an earn-in period commencing in January 2010 and completing in
December 2012 (the “earn-in period”). Upon completion of the earn-in period, a joint venture (the “Joint Venture”)
is to be formed with the same 75% / 25% interest the parties held during the earn-in period. The Joint Venture shall remain in
effect for twenty-five years or as long as the claims are being actively mined or developed,
whichever is longer. After the termination of the Joint Venture, the Claims shall revert back to Trio. On March 23, 2012, the Company and Trio entered
into an agreement that modified certain terms of the original agreement (“modified agreement”). During the earn-in-period,
the Company is to provide $5,500,000 in funding to cover operational costs. Under the original agreement, $1,500,000 was to be
funded during the 2010 budget year, $2,000,000 was to be funded during the 2011 budget year and $2,000,000 was to be funded during
the 2012 budget year. The modified agreement eliminates the annual funding requirements and extends the due date of the $5,500,000
funding to December 31, 2013. Under the original agreement, the Company was
required to pay a minimum annual royalty during the earn-in period to Trio of which $75,000 was paid upon signing of the agreement,
$100,000 was paid on April 1, 2011 and $150,000 was to be paid on April 1, 2012. Under the terms of the March 23, 2012 modified
agreement, the minimum royalty payments have been incorporated into the $5,500,000 funding requirement and the final $150,000 minimum
royalty payment becomes due on April 1, 2013. In consideration for modifying the terms of the original agreement and extending
the due date, the Company issued Trio 2,788 shares of its common shares valued at $11,152, which was charged to operations and
included in exploratory costs. Once the Company has provided $5,500,000 in
funding for the project, the Company and Trio shall fund the operational costs jointly, with the Company providing 75% of the funds
and Trio providing 25% of the funds. Through July 31, 2012, the Company funded a total of $2,350,000 in the property’s operational
costs as defined under the modified agreement. The funds paid have been charged to operations and included in exploratory costs. In addition, within three months of the assignment,
the Company is required to issue Trio 144,240 shares of its common stock. Upon expenditure of a minimum of $2,000,000 on the claims,
Trio shall receive an additional 1,442 shares of the Company’s common stock. Upon expending a minimum of $4,000,000 on the
claims, Trio shall receive an additional 1,442 shares of the Company’s common stock. Upon expenditure of $5,500,000 on the
claims, Trio shall receive a final 1,442 shares of the Company’s common stock All shares issued shall be restricted common
shares and will be stamped with the applicable hold period. On February 22, 2010, the Company issued 2,884 shares of its common
stock to Trio valued at $242,323, based upon the restated trading price of the shares on the date of issuance. On October 25, 2011,
the Company issued 1,442 shares of its common stock to Trio valued at $5,769, based upon the trading price of the shares on the
date of issuance. On March 23, 2012, the Company issued 2,788 shares of its common stock to Trio valued at $11,152, based upon
the restated trading price of the shares on the date of issuance. The values of the shares have been charged to operations and
included in exploration costs. On February 13, 2013, the Company entered into
an agreement with Trio to modify the terms of the above indicated final minimum royalty payment of $150,000, which was due on April
1, 2013. In exchange for paying $15,000 upon the signing of the agreement and $5,000 on August 1, 2013, the due date of the remaining
$130,000 is extended to October 1, 2013, with the date when the full $5,500,000 must be spent on the Rodeo Claims is extended to
December 31, 2014. Of the $20,000 that is due, $15,000 was paid on February 20, 2013 and $5,000 was paid on March 15, 2013. The
$20,000 was charged to exploratory costs. The Company failed to pay the required $130,000
that was due on October 1, 2013 and is in default under the agreement. In December 2014, the Company notified Trio
of its intent to terminate its agreement on the Rodeo Creek Property. The Company will have no further interest in this project.
The Company has earned a 2% Net Smelter Royalty on the property and has granted Trio the exclusive right and option at any time
to buy back 100% of the Royalty by paying to the Company a cash consideration of $3,000,000.00 (USD) (the “Buy Back Option”).
The Buy Back Option may be exercised at any time in part by Trio paying $1,500,000.00 (USD) for each one percent (1%) of the Royalty
purchased by Trio. F- 9 Cueva Blanca Gold Property On April 16, 2010, the Company entered into
an agreement with St. Elias Mines Ltd. (“St. Elias”) in which Amarok is given an option to earn a 60% interest, subject
to a 1.5% net smelter royalty (“NSR”) in the Cueva Blanca gold property (1,200 hectares) in Northern Peru, which is
wholly owned by St. Elias . Under the terms of the letter agreement, it is possible for the Company to acquire a 60%
interest in the Property (subject to a 1.5% NSR) in consideration of: (a) making cash payments of $200,000
to St. Elias over a two-year period; (b) issuing 100,000 common shares
in the capital of Amarok to St. Elias; and (c) incurring at least $1,500,000
in exploration expenditures on the property over a three-year period. In addition, the Company shall have the right
to purchase one-half of the 1.5% NSR from St. Elias for the sum of $1,500,000, thereby reducing the NSR payable to from 1.5% to
0.75%. The Company’s first payment of $10,000
was paid on June 24, 2010. On April 27, 2011, the agreement between St. Elias and Amarok was formally terminated by St. Elias.
As of January 31, 2012, the Company has paid a total of $27,603 in fees towards property maintenance costs on the Cueva Blanca
property. The company has no further interest in this
property Mining properties at October 31,
2014 consist of the following: Beginning balance –November 1, 2013 $ 689,710 Acquisition related costs — Cost charged off as impaired (689,710 ) Balance – October 31, 2014 $ — Management’s decision to change its focus
from the mining sector to manufacturing was based on the declining condition of the resource sector over the past years. It was
becoming significantly more difficult to raise funds for working capital and property development as a resource company, Management
felt it was in the best interest for the continued viability of the company to focus efforts within an industry that has the potential
for generating cash flow sooner than would be possible in the resource sector. NOTE 4 - RELATED PARTY
TRANSACTIONS On December 18, 2013, the Company purchased
various equipment relating to its 3D metal printing operation from Mr. Janssen for $500,000. The $500,000 is evidenced by a promissory
note assessed interest at an annual rate of 1.64%. Accrued interest is payable quarterly with the Principal balance and any unpaid
accrued interest fully due and payable on December 15, 2018. Mr. Janssen has the right to convert any outstanding principal and
accrued interest into restricted shares of the of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price of $0.50 per share. The
balance due Mr. Janssen at October 31, 2014 totaled $507,022 of which the accrued interest of $7,022 was classified as a short-term
liability and the $500,000 was classified as a long-term liability. The accrued interest of $7,022 was charged to operations. The
Company has not paid any accrued interest. During the year ended October 31,
2014, Mr. Janssen advanced the Company a total of $44,742, which was fully repaid during the year. F- 10 NOTE 5 - EQUIPMENT By way of agreement concurrent with Mr. Janssen’s
appointment to the Board of Directors and entry into an Employment Agreement (see Note 9 – Commitments and Contingencies
below) and executed on December 18, 2013, the Company purchased various equipment relating to the post production processes for
its 3D metal printing operation from Mr. Janssen, our sole officer and director, for $500,000 which amount has been capitalized
on our balance sheet. On December 23, 2013, the Company purchased
equipment from an unrelated third party for $750,000 of which $75,000 was paid. The remaining $675,000 is payable in two installments:
$375,000 due June 1, 2014 and $300,000 due on September 1, 2014. The terms of the installment payments do not include a stated
interest rate, therefore, the Company accounted for the purchase under ASC Topic 835-30-25 “Imputation of Interest ” discounting the purchase price of the equipment by $18,795 for imputed interest using an interest rate of 5% per annum. The
total gross capitalized value of this equipment is $731,025. The Company failed to make the required installment

note which is assessed interest at an annual rate of 5% per annum. Principal and accrued interest are paid in monthly installments
of $20,230 commencing on December 1, 2014. The Company has made payments as required under the terms of the agreement up to the
month of January 2015. The balance due on this obligation at October
31, 2014 is $675,740. A schedule of each year’s principal payments for this obligation is as follows: Principal Year ended Reduction October 31, 2015 $ 195,638 October 31, 2016 223,881 October 31, 2017 235,335 October 31, 2018 20,146 $ 675,000 During the year ended October 31, 2014 in connection

PARTY On January 15, 2013, the Company granted Santeo
Financial Corp (“Santeo”), a company affiliated with a former officer and director, the option to convert up to 25%
of all accrued compensation resulting from unpaid consulting fees due it at that date into shares of the Company’s common
stock at a conversion price of $0.001 per share, and to convert the remaining 75% of accrued compensation due it at that date into
shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price of $0.01 per share. The agreement can be cancelled by either party.
At January 15, 2013, the amount of accrued compensation due Santeo was $175,000. Pursuant to ASC Topic 470-20, “Debt with
Conversion and Other Options,” the accrued compensation was recorded net of a discount that includes the debt’s
beneficial conversion feature of $148,077. Since the accrued compensation is immediately convertible into common stock, discounts
arising from beneficial conversion features are directly charged to expense pursuant to ACS 470-20-35. The beneficial conversion
features were calculated using trading prices ranging from $0.001 to $0.01 per share and an effective conversion price of $0.02
per share. Effective December 18, 2013, the terms of the
above indicated option grant were modified limiting the number of conversion shares Santeo can receive and hold at any point in
time to no more than 9.99% of the Company’s common stock then outstanding. In June 2014, Santeo assigned $1,000 of accrued
compensation due it to a third party, who converted the $1,000 into 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion
price of $.001 per share Total consulting fees charged to operations

Accounting Standard Codification Topic No. 740 (“ASC 740”), “Accounting for Income Taxes.” This statement
mandates the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and permits the recognition of deferred tax assets subject
to an ongoing assessment of realizability. The
effective tax rate on the net loss before income taxes differs from the U.S. statutory rate as follows: October 31, October 31, 2014 2013 Current expense - Benefit Federal $ — $ — State — — Total deferred expense (benefit) — — Deferred Benefit Federal $ — $ — State — — Total deferred benefit — — U.S statutory rate 34.00 % 34.00 % Less valuation allowance -34.00 % -34.00 % Effective tax rate 0.00 % 0.00 % The significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows: Deferred tax assets Stock based compensation $ (1,632,000 ) $ 131,435 Net operating losses 5,164,685 1,294,544 Other (2,421 ) — Deferred tax liabilities Property and equipment (111,638 ) 0 3,641,902 1,425,979 Less valuation allowance (3,641,902 ) (1,425,979 ) Deferred tax asset/liabilities - net valuation allowance $ — $ — Deferred income tax assets and liabilities
are computed annually for differences between financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable
or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are
expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount
expected to be realized. Income tax expense is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the change during the
period in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets resulting from stock based
compensation and net operating losses are reduced by a valuation allowance, when, in the opinion of management, utilization is
not reasonably assured. At October 31, 2014, the Company’s gross deferred tax asset totaled $3,641,902. This amount was reduced
100% by a valuation allowance, making the net deferred tax asset $0. As of October 31, 2014, the Company had estimated
federal net operating loss carry forwards totaling approximately $6,101,462 which can be used to offset future federal income tax.
The federal net operating loss carry forwards expire at various dates through 2034. The utilization of the net operating losses
to offset future net taxable income is subject to the limitations imposed by the change in control under Internal Revenue Code
Section 382. The Company adopted the provisions of Accounting
Standard Codification Topic 740-10-50, formerly FIN 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.” We had no material
unrecognized income tax assets or liabilities for the year ended October 31, 2014 or October 31, 2013. Company management policy regarding income
tax interest and penalties is to expense those items as general and administrative expense but to identify them for tax purposes.
During the year ended October 31, 2014 and 2013, there were no income tax, or related interest and penalty items in the income
statement, or liability on the balance sheet. The company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various
state jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal or state income tax examination by tax authorities for years
before 2008. The Company is not currently involved in any income tax examinations. F- 12 NOTE 9 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Effective November 23, 2013, the Company entered
into an employment agreement with its President and Chief Executive Officer, Roger Janssen. Under the terms of the agreement, Mr.
Janssen will receive a base salary of $15,000 a month over the three-year term of the agreement. At the sole discretion of the
board of directors, Mr. Janssen may be granted performance bonuses and may also participate in any incentive plans that the Company
may establish. In addition, Mr. Janssen received 30,000,000 shares of the Company’s restricted common stock as a signing
bonus. The shares were valued at $4,800,000 based upon the trading price of the shares on the date of grant. Officer’s compensation
for the year ended October 31, 2014 amounted to $4,887,449 including the indicated stock based compensation of $4,800,000. Accrued
compensation due Mr. Janssen as of October 31, 2014 amounted to $149,135, which is included in the balance of other payables –
related parties as reflected in the accompanying balance sheet. The $149,135 is net of $13,286 that was actually paid to Mr. Janssen
during the year ended October 31, 2014. In January 2014, the Company entered into lease
for warehouse and corporate office space located in Ferndale, Washington for 26 months. The Company was granted an option to extend
the lease for another two years. Rent expense charged to operations for the year ended October 31, 2014 amounted to $51,593 of
which $13,245 was allocated to research and development. Minimum future rental payments under non-cancelable
operating leases having remaining terms in excess of one year as of October 31, 2014 during the term of the respective lease and
in the aggregate are as follows: October 31, 2015 $ 51,300 2016 17,100 Total minimum lease payments $ 68,400 End of Notes to Financials F- 13 ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE On December 11, 2014, the
Company dismissed Robison, Hill and Co. (“Robison”) as the registered independent registered public accountant and
appointed MaloneBailey, LLP (“MaloneBailey”) as the Company’s registered independent public accounting firm as
of December 11, 2014. The decisions to appoint MaloneBailey and dismiss Robison were approved by the Board of Directors of the
Company on December 11, 2014. Other than the disclosure
of uncertainty regarding the ability for us to continue as a going concern which was included in our accountant’s report
on the financial statements for the year ended October 31, 2013, Robison’s reports on the financial statements of the Company
for the year ended October 31, 2013 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified
as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles. For the most recent fiscal year and any subsequent interim period through
Robison's termination on December 11, 2014, Robison disclosed the uncertainty regarding the ability of the Company to continue
as a going concern in its accountant’s report on the financial statements. In connection with the
audit and review of the financial statements of the Company through December 11, 2014, there were no disagreements on any matter
of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosures, or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements if
not resolved to their satisfaction would have caused them to make reference in connection with Robison’s opinion to the subject
matter of the disagreement. In connection with the
audited financial statements of the Company for the year ended October 31, 2013 and interim unaudited financial statements through
December 11, 2014, there have been no reportable events with the Company as set forth in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. Prior to December 11, 2014,
the Company did not consult with MaloneBailey regarding (1) the application of accounting principles to specified transactions,
(2) the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company’s financial statements, (3) written or oral advice was
provided that would be an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to an accounting, auditing or financial
reporting issues, or (4) any matter that was the subject of a disagreement between the Company and its predecessor auditor as described
in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) or a reportable event as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. The Company provided a
copy of the foregoing disclosures to Robison prior to the date of the filing of this report and requested that Robison furnish
it with a letter addressed to the Securities & Exchange Commission stating whether or not it agrees with the statements in
this Report. A copy of the letter furnished in response to that request was filed as Exhibit 16.1 to the Company’s Current
Report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on December 11, 2014, incorporated herein by reference. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure
controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange
Act"), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission's rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. A control system, no matter
how well conceived or operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system
are met. Based on this evaluation,
our principal executive and principal financial and accounting officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) were not effective as of October 31, 2014. Management’s Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting Our Management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(c) and (d) of the
Exchange Act. Our internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the reported financial information is presented
fairly, financial disclosures are adequate and that the judgments inherent in the preparation of financial statements are reasonable
and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States of America (GAAP). Because of its inherent
limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect
to financial statement preparation and presentation. Further, because of changes in conditions, effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting may vary over time A significant deficiency
is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that adversely affects the company’s ability to initiate,
authorize, record, process, or report external financial data reliably in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
such that there is more than a remote likelihood that a misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements
that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected. An internal control material weakness is a significant deficiency,
or combination of significant deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual
or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. 26 As part of our compliance
efforts relative to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting as of October 31, 2014. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in the Internal
Control - Integrated Framework by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). We evaluated control deficiencies identified through our test of the design and operating effectiveness of controls over financial
reporting to determine whether the deficiencies, individually or in combination, are significant deficiencies or material weaknesses.
In performing the assessment, our management has identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting existing
as of October 31, 2014. Our evaluation of the significance of each deficiency included both quantitative and qualitative factors.
Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that as of October 31, 2014, and as of the date that the evaluation of the effectiveness
of our internal controls and procedures was completed, our internal controls are not effective, for the reason discussed below: 1. We do not yet have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal controls over financial reporting is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and may be applicable to us in future years. 2. We do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions, which is a basic internal control. Due to our extremely small size and the fact that we only had one management employee, whom is also an executive officer and director, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate individuals. 3. We do not currently have full-time accounting personnel, which means we lack the requisite expertise in the key functional areas of finance and accounting. We rely upon a third party accountant firm to assist us in our accounting and reporting. 4. We do not have a functioning audit committee, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures. 5. We had not established adequate financial reporting monitoring activities to mitigate the risk of management override, specifically because there are no employees and only one officer and director with management functions and therefore there is lack of segregation of duties. 6. There is a strong reliance on the external auditors and contract accountant to review and adjust the annual and quarterly financial statements, to monitor new accounting principles, and to ensure compliance with GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements. 7. There is a strong reliance on the external attorneys to review and edit the annual and quarterly filings and to ensure compliance with SEC disclosure requirements. In light of the material
weaknesses described above, we performed additional analysis and other post-closing procedures to ensure our financial statements
were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, we believe that the financial statements
included in this Report fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows
for the periods presented. In addition, although our
internal controls are not effective, these significant weaknesses did not result in any material misstatements in our financial
statements. Our management is committed to improving its internal controls and will (1) continue to use third party specialists
to address shortfalls in staffing and to assist us with accounting and finance responsibilities, (2) increase the frequency of
independent reconciliations of significant accounts which is intended to mitigate the lack of segregation of duties until there
are sufficient personnel and (3) we plan to establish an audit committee in the future. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There has been no change
in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with our evaluation we conducted of the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2014, that occurred during our fourth fiscal quarter that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. This annual report does
not include an attestation report of the Company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by the Company’s registered public accounting firm
pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management’s report in this annual report. Continuing Remediation Efforts to address
deficiencies in Company’s Internal Control over Financial Reporting Once the Company has sufficient
personnel available, then our Board of Directors, in particular and in connection with the aforementioned deficiencies, will establish
the following remediation measures: 1. Our Board of Directors will nominate an audit committee or a financial expert on our Board of Directors. 2. We will appoint additional personnel to assist with the preparation of the Company’s monthly financial reporting, including preparation of the monthly bank reconciliations. ITEM 9B.

during the past five years of the person presently listed above as an Officer or Director of the Company is as follows: ROGER JANSSEN , is
the founder of Key Manufacturing (“Key”), and has acted as president of Key for the past 23 years. In addition to his
position at Key, Mr. Janssen was a director of Mineralite Corporation, a Company traded on the OTCBB market under the symbol “RITE”
for the past two years prior to joining 3DX Industries, Inc. Mr. Janssen resigned from his position with Mineralrite on November
14, 2013. Mr. Janssen has more than thirty years of experience in the manufacturing industry. He has secured lucrative contracts
within a range of industries: marine, military, automotive, alternative energy, medical, and aerospace. Clients include, but are
not limited to, Boeing, Raytheon, BE Aerospace, British Petroleum and Intermec. Because of Mr. Janssen’s
dedication to new technological developments, Key Manufacturing has been able to provide the Puget Sound with high quality manufacturing
and machine services since 1989. Over the years, Mr. Janssen has proven his ability to reinvent himself by staying profitable even
through economic lows within the industry, such as after 9/11. One example of this is Mr. Janssen’s keen ability to recognize
new business opportunities, as he did in 2004, when he added a ZCorp310- 3 D printer, which instigated his current experience with
additive manufacturing. During his twenty-four year tenor at Key manufacturing, Mr. Janssen has gained immeasurable experience
in management, operations, human resources, equipment procurement, strategic planning, sales and business development, contract
negotiation, and financial reporting. Mr. Janssen holds a technical
degree in precision machining and manufacturing, earned in 1981 from the Sno-Isle Tech Centre in Everett, WA. He is always seeking
to expand and update his business knowledge, and has actively continued his education by taking financial, business and marketing
courses at his local community college. Recognizing his impeccable reputation as an industry leader in the area, the Sno-isle Tech
Centre recruited Mr. Janssen to serve on their advisory board, which he did for the following eight years. Three of those years
were spent as Chairman of the Board, making decisions about the Centre’s curriculum, as well as approving qualified faculty
and budget allocations. Mr. Janssen has since acted as a consultant and member of the board to a variety of private and public
companies within the industry. EARL W. ABBOTT, received
his Ph.D. in geology at Rice University, Houston, Texas where he studied the tectonics of the western U.S. He has spent a total
of 43 years exploring for gold, base metals, oil and gas, uranium, and other resources all over the world. Utilizing his education
and experience, he combines strong management skills with a creative vision that enables him to apply sound scientific principles
to the search for giant ore deposits. In the early part of his career, his management of an exploration program in Nevada resulted
in the acquisition of three gold ore bodies that were subsequently mined profitably. During his career, Dr. Abbott
has been a key member of several large and small mining companies and a consultant to the mining industry continuously for more
than 31 years. From 2004 to the present day, Dr. Abbott has acted as Director of Big Bar Resources Corporation (TSX-V) assisting
in exploration in the western U.S., Mexico, and China. From 2008 to 2009, Dr. Abbott was the COO and Director of Uranium 3O8 Corp.
(OTC-BB), managing a uranium project in Mongolia. In 2009, Dr. Abbott assisted in forming Coyote Resources (OTC-BB) and acted as
President and CEO until 2012, exploring a gold project and a silver project in Nevada. During 2012 and 2013, Dr. Abbott aided in
the formation of a private company called New Century Energy and Resources to perform exploration for projects in Mongolia. Dr. Abbott is active in
his profession, having been a member and served as an executive of professional mining associations. As a result, he has an extensive
network of technical as well as leadership contacts. He is a Certified Professional Geologist (C.P.G., No. 7611) by the American
Institute of Professional Geologists (AIPG) as well as being the past President of the Nevada Chapter. He is also a member and

Financial Expert The Company does not have
an audit committee or an audit committee financial expert (as defined in Item 407 of Regulation S-K) serving on its Board of Directors.
All current members of the Board of Directors lack sufficient financial expertise for overseeing financial reporting responsibilities.
The Company has not yet employed an audit committee financial expert on its Board due to the inability to attract such a person. The Company intends to
establish an audit committee of the board of directors, which will consist of independent directors. The audit committee’s
duties will be to recommend to the Company’s board of directors the engagement of an independent registered public accounting
firm to audit the Company’s financial statements and to review the Company’s accounting and auditing principles. The
audit committee will review the scope, timing and fees for the annual audit and the results of audit examinations performed by
the internal auditors and independent registered public accounting firm, including their recommendations to improve the system
of accounting and internal controls. The audit committee will at all times be composed exclusively of directors who are, in the
opinion of the Company’s board of directors, free from any relationship which would interfere with the exercise of independent
judgment as a committee member and who possess an understanding of financial statements and generally accepted accounting principles. 8) Code Of Ethics Our board of directors
has not adopted a code of ethics due to the fact that we presently only have two directors and we are in the start-up stage of
our operations. We anticipate that we will adopt a code of ethics when we increase either the number of our directors and officers
or the number of our employees. 9) Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance We
do not yet have a class of equity securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Hence,
compliance with Section 16(a) thereof by our officers and directors is not required. 30 ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION Compensation of Officers The following tables set

Ruskowsky, for consulting services of $8,000 a month on a month-to-month basis. On July 1, 2011, the consulting agreement was amended
to increase the monthly payment to $15,000. On January 15, 2013, the Company granted Santeo the option to convert up to $43,750

the above indicated option. Other than the Employment
Agreement with Roger Janssen discussed above in Footnote 2 to the Summary Compensation Table, there are no other employment contracts,
compensatory plans or arrangements, including payments to be received from the Company with respect to any executive officer, that
would result in payments to such person because of his or her resignation, retirement or other termination of employment with the

Suite #368, 16 Midlake Blvd SE Calgary AB T2X 2X7 3,742,453(5) 9.99% (1)	Percentage ownership is determined based
on shares owned together with securities exercisable or convertible into shares of common stock within 60 days of the date of this
Annual Report for each stockholder. Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC and generally includes
voting or investment power with respect to securities. Shares of common stock subject to securities exercisable or convertible
into shares of common stock that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of the date of this Annual Report are
deemed to be beneficially owned by the person holding such securities for the purpose of computing the percentage of ownership
of such person, but are not treated as outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. Our
common stock is our only issued and outstanding class of securities eligible to vote. (2) Applicable percentage of ownership
is based on 37,462,000 shares of common stock outstanding, and no warrants or options outstanding as of February 13, 2015. (3) Roger Janssen is the President, CEO,
CFO, and Director of the Company. His beneficial ownership includes 30,002,000 common shares. (4) Earl Abbot is a Director of the Company
and Vice President of Exploration. His beneficial ownership includes 600 common shares. (5) On January 15, 2013, Santeo Financial
Corp, was granted the option to convert up to $43,750 in accrued compensation due it into shares of the Company’s common
stock at a conversion price of $0.001 per share, and to convert $131,250 of accrued compensation due it into shares of the Company’s
common stock at a conversion price of $0.01 per share. Effective December 18, 2013, the Company and Santeo agreed to institute
an ownership limitation, under which no issuance of common stock shares of the Corporation to Santeo shall result in the issuance
of more than that number of common stock shares, if any, such that, upon issuance, the aggregate beneficial ownership of the Corporation’s
Common Stock (calculated pursuant to Rule 13d-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) of Santeo and all persons affiliated
with Santeo (“Beneficial Ownership”) is more than 9.99% of the Corporation’s Common Stock then outstanding. Thus,
based on 37,462,000 shares issued and outstanding as of the date of this report, Santeo has the option to convert a portion of
the debt owed by the Company to Santeo equivalent to a maximum of 3,742,453 shares of common stock. Changes in Control There are no present arrangements
or pledges of the Company’s securities which may result in a change in control of the Company. 32 ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE Director Independence For purposes of determining
director independence, we have applied the definitions set out in NASDAQ Rule 5605(a)(2). The OTCBB on which shares of common stock
are quoted does not have any director independence requirements. The NASDAQ definition of “Independent Officer” means
a person other than an Executive Officer or employee of the Company or any other individual having a relationship which, in the
opinion of the Company's Board of Directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities
of a director. According to the NASDAQ
definition, Roger Janssen is not an independent director because he is also an executive officer of the Company. According to the
NASDAQ definition, Earl W. Abbott is not an independent director because he is also a shareholder of the Company. Related Party Transactions Effective November 23,
2013, the Company entered into an employment agreement with its President and Chief Executive Officer, Roger Janssen. Under the
terms of the agreement, Mr. Janssen will receive a base salary of $15,000 a month over the three-year term of the agreement. At
the sole discretion of the board of directors, Mr. Janssen may be granted performance bonuses and may also participate in any incentive
plans that the Company may establish. In addition, Mr. Janssen received 30,000,000 shares of the Company’s restricted common
stock as a signing bonus. The shares were valued at $4,800,000 based upon the trading price of the shares on the date of grant.
Officer’s compensation for the year ended October 31, 2014 amounted to $4,969,000 including the indicated stock based compensation
of $4,800,000. Accrued compensation due Mr. Janssen as of October 31, 2014 amounted to $155,714, which is included in the balance
of other payables – related parties as reflected in the accompanying balance sheet. The $155,714 is net of $13,286 that was
actually paid to Mr. Janssen during the year ended October 31, 2014. On December 18, 2013, the
Company purchased various equipment relating to its 3D metal printing operation from Mr. Janssen for $500,000. The $500,000 is
evidenced by a promissory note assessed interest at an annual rate of 1.64%. Accrued interest is payable quarterly with the Principal
balance and any unpaid accrued interest fully due and payable on December 15, 2018. Mr. Janssen has the right to convert any outstanding
principal and accrued interest into restricted shares of the of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price of $0.50
per share. The balance due Mr. Janssen at October 31, 2014 totaled $507,122 of which the accrued interest of $7,022 was classified
as a short-term liability and the $500,000 was classified as a long-term liability. The accrued interest of $7,022 was charged
to operations. The Company has not paid any accrued interest. During the year ended
October 31, 2014, Mr. Janssen advanced the Company a total of $44,742, which was fully repaid during the year. Other than the foregoing,
none of the directors or executive officers of the Company, nor any person who owned of record or was known to own beneficially
more than 5% of the Company’s outstanding shares of its Common Stock, nor any associate or affiliate of such persons or companies,
has any material interest, direct or indirect, in any transaction that has occurred during the past fiscal year, or in any proposed
transaction, which has materially affected or will affect the Company. With regard to any future
related party transaction, we plan to fully disclose any and all related party transactions in the following manner: · Disclosing such transactions in reports where required; · Disclosing in any and all filings with the SEC, where required; · Obtaining disinterested directors consent; and · Obtaining shareholder consent where required.
