SUBSTITUTE INFORMATION INCLUDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERAL INSTRUCTION J TO FORM 10-K: ITEM 1112(b) OF REGULATION AB. (SIGNIFICANT OBLIGORS OF POOL ASSETS) There is no single obligor that represents more than 10% of the pool assets. ITEM 1114(b)(2) OF REGULATION AB. (CREDIT ENHANCEMENT AND OTHER SUPPORT, EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN DERIVATIVES
INSTRUMENTS (FINANCIAL INFORMATION)) There is no external credit enhancement or other support provider that is liable to provide payments supporting
any notes or certificates issued by the Issuing Entity. ITEM 1115(b) OF REGULATION AB. (CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INFORMATION (FINANCIAL INFORMATION)) No entity provides any derivative instruments that are used to alter the payment characteristics of the cash flows from the Issuing Entity. ITEM 1117 OF REGULATION AB. (LEGAL PROCEEDINGS) General Motors Financial Company, Inc. (the Company), the ultimate parent of the registrant, has been served with investigative subpoenas to
produce documents from state attorneys general and other governmental offices relating to its sub-prime auto finance business and securitization of sub-prime auto loans. In addition, the Company received a document request from the Securities
and Exchange Commission in connection with its investigation into certain practices in sub-prime auto loan securitization. The Company is investigating these matters internally and believes the Company is cooperating with all requests. Such
investigations could in the future result in the imposition of damages, fines or civil or criminal claims and/or penalties. On November 24, 2014, a
group of investors filed a civil complaint against multiple trustees in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, purportedly on behalf of and for the benefit of certain residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS)
trusts. These filings assert claims for alleged failure by the trustees to enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations and warranties, to notify investors of alleged events of default purportedly
caused by breaches by mortgage loan servicers and failure to abide by appropriate standards of care following alleged events of default. ITEM 1119
OF REGULATION AB. (AFFILIATIONS AND CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS) AmeriCredit Financial Services Inc., the Sponsor and the servicer,
is a Delaware corporation and is the originator of 100% of the automobile loan contracts. The Sponsor purchases automobile loan contracts that are originated and assigned to it by automobile dealers and, to a lesser extent, third-party lenders and
also originates automobile loan contracts directly with consumers, either directly or through a wholly-owned subsidiary. The Sponsor services all automobile loan contracts that it purchases or originates on behalf of the Issuing Entity, AmeriCredit
Automobile Receivables Trust 2013-5, a Delaware statutory trust. The Sponsor sold and assigned the pool of initial automobile loan contracts to AFS
SenSub Corp., the Depositor, a Nevada corporation. The Depositor then sold the pool of sub-prime automobile loan contracts to the Issuing Entity and is the sole owner of the certificate of the Issuing Entity. General Motors Financial of Canada, Ltd., or GMF of Canada , is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Sponsor. GMF of Canada services a portion of the automobile loan contracts in the United States on behalf of the Issuing Entity through its service center in Peterborough, Ontario. GMF of Canada utilizes the Sponsors standardized servicing
policies and procedures and operates on the same single, unified and interconnected software platform that the Sponsors other servicing centers utilize. GMF of Canada is managed by the same executive officers of the Sponsor that oversee the
rest of the Sponsors operations, including servicing through its other servicing centers. GMF of Canada is operated as a separate legal entity from the Sponsor due solely to the location of its servicing center in a foreign jurisdiction,
despite being operated identically to the Sponsors other servicing centers and not as a stand-alone entity (other than as is required for regulatory and corporate governance purposes).

Choate Title: Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Date: March 30, 2015 EX-33.1 3 d899646dex331.htm EX-33.1 EX-33.1 Exhibit 33.1 Managements Assertion Regarding Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria AmeriCredit Financial Services, Inc. (AFSI) is responsible for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to it under paragraph
(d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014 (the Reporting Period). The transactions covered by this report include publicly issued auto loan asset-backed securities transactions
issued from September 23, 2010 to December 31, 2014 for which we acted as servicer involving auto loans (the Platform). The individual asset-backed transactions that we have defined as constituting the Platform are included in
Appendix A. Applicable Servicing Criteria : All servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) except for the following criteria:
1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122 (d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii), and 1122(d)(4)(xiii), which we have determined are not applicable to the activities we perform with respect to the
Platform (the Applicable Servicing Criteria). Third parties classified as vendors : With respect to servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(i) we
have engaged various vendors to serve as repositories for customer payments (i.e. a lockbox bank and a third party money wire transfer provider) as required by the servicing criteria. We have determined that none of the vendors are a
servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and we elect to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the portion of the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by Interpretation 17.06 of the SEC
Division of Corporation Finance Manual of Publicly Available Telephone Interpretations (Interpretation 17.06). These outsourced activities themselves are immaterial, and we do not believe that AFSI is required to provide an assessment of
its compliance with those oversight procedures pursuant to Item 1122(d)(1)(ii). We have policies and procedures in place to provide reasonable assurance that each vendors activities comply in all material respects with the servicing
criteria applicable to each vendor. AFSI has taken responsibility for assessing compliance with the portion of the servicing criterion performed by those vendors. We are solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply
Interpretation 17.06 for the vendors and related criteria. With respect to the Platform and the Reporting Period, we provide the following assessment of
compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria: 1. We are responsible for assessing our compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 2. We have assessed compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria, including servicing criteria for which compliance is determined based on Interpretation 17.06 as described above, as of and for the Reporting Period.
In performing this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. 3. We were in material compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria as of and for the Reporting Period. 4. If applicable with respect to the Platform, all data files were transferred to the back-up servicer on a timely basis. 5. There were no external enhancements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014 within the Platform. 6. We have not identified and are not aware of any material instance of noncompliance by the vendors with regard to the Applicable Servicing Criteria, or performance of certain functions with regard to the Applicable
Servicing Criteria, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014, with respect to the Platform taken as a whole. 7. We have not identified any material deficiencies in our policies and procedures to monitor the compliance by the vendors with the Applicable Servicing Criteria, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014 with
respect to the Platform taken as a whole. Deloitte & Touche LLP, a registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation
report with respect to our foregoing assessment of compliance as of and for the Reporting Period. AmeriCredit Financial Services, Inc.

provide this platform-level assessment of compliance with the servicing criteria specified in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management has determined that the servicing criteria are
applicable in regard to the servicing platform as of and for the period as follows: Platform : Publicly-issued (i.e., transaction-level reporting
initially required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) asset-backed securities issued on or after January 1, 2006 and like-kind transactions issued prior to January 1, 2006 that are subject to Regulation AB for which the
Company provides trustee, securities administration, paying agent or custodial services, as defined and to the extent applicable in the transaction agreements, other than residential mortgage-backed securities and other mortgage-related asset-backed
securities (the Platform). Period : Twelve months ended December 31, 2014 (the Period). Applicable Servicing Criteria : All servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d), to the extent required by the related transaction agreements as
to any transaction, except as set forth in the column titled Not Applicable To Platform in Appendix 1 attached hereto. With
respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(2)(vi) management has engaged a vendor to perform the activities required by the servicing criterion. Management has determined that this vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in
Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and management has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criterion applicable to this vendor as permitted by the SECs Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation
(CD&I) 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (CD&I 200.06) (formerly SEC Manual Telephone Interpretation 17.06). Management has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the
vendors activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criterion applicable to the vendor. Management is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply CD&I 200.06 for the vendor and related
criterion. With respect to the Platform as of and for the Period, the Company provides the following assessment of
compliance in respect of the Applicable Servicing Criteria: 1. The Company is responsible for assessing its compliance with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria. 2. The Company has assessed compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria including the servicing criterion for which compliance is
determined based on CD&I 200.06 as described above. In performing this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. 3. With respect to Applicable Servicing Criteria 1122(d)(2)(iii) and 1122(d)(4)(vii), there were no activities performed during the Period with respect to the
Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities. 4. Based on such assessment, as of and
for the Period, the Company has complied, in all material respects, with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. KPMG LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, has issued an attestation report with respect to Managements Assertion of Compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria as of and for the Period. 2 The Bank of New York Mellon BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware /s/ Richard P.

AmeriCredit Financial Services Inc. Fort Worth, Texas We have examined managements assertion, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Assessment of Compliance with SEC Regulation AB
Servicing Criteria, that AmeriCredit Financial Services Inc. (the Company) complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commissions Regulation AB for publicly issued auto loan
asset-backed securities transactions issued from September 23, 2010 to December 31, 2014 for which the Company acted as servicer involving auto loans (the Platform) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014, excluding
criteria 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122 (d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii), and 1122(d)(4)(xiii), which management has determined are not applicable to the activities performed by
the Company with respect to the Platform. Appendix A to managements assertion identifies the individual asset-backed transactions defined by management as constituting the Platform. Management is responsible for the Companys
compliance with the servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assertion about the Companys compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Companys compliance with the applicable servicing criteria, including tests on a sample basis of the servicing activities related to the Platform, determining whether the Company performed those
selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria during the specified period, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our procedures were limited to selected servicing activities performed
by the Company during the period covered by this report and, accordingly, such samples may not have included servicing activities related to each asset-backed transaction included in the Platform. Further, an examination is not designed to detect
noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to the period specified above that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that our
examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Companys compliance with the servicing criteria. As described in managements assertion, for servicing criterion item 1122(d)(2)(i), the Company has engaged a vendor to perform certain activities
required by this servicing criterion. The Company has determined that this vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing
compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to this vendor as permitted by the SECs Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C&DI 200.06) (formerly SEC Manual Telephone
Interpretation 17.06). As permitted by C&DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with the
servicing criteria applicable to this vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C&DI 200.06 for the vendor and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no
procedures with respect to the Companys determination of its eligibility to apply C&DI 200.06. In our opinion, managements assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned applicable
servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014 for the Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects. /s/

York Mellon (formerly The Bank of New York), BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware (formerly BNYM (Delaware)) and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (formerly The Bank of New York Trust, Company, N.A.), (collectively, the Company)
complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commissions Regulation AB for the publicly-issued (i.e., transaction-level reporting initially required under the Securities and Exchange Act of
1934, as amended) asset-backed securities issued on or after January 1, 2006 and like-kind transactions issued prior to January 1, 2006 that are subject to Regulation AB for which the Company provides trustee, securities administration,

activities it performs with respect to the Platform, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. With respect to applicable servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(iii) and 1122(d)(4)(vii), the Company has determined that there were no
activities performed during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 with respect to the Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities. Management is responsible for the
Companys compliance with the servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assertion about the Companys compliance based on our examination. Our examination was conducted in accordance with the attestation standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly,
included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Companys compliance with the servicing criteria specified above and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing
selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected
activities in compliance with the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed
to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or
any other transactions. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Companys compliance with the servicing criteria. As described in the Companys Assertion of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, for servicing
criterion 1122(d)(2)(vi), the Company has engaged a vendor to perform the activities required by this servicing criterion. The Company has determined that this vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of
Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criterion applicable to this vendor as permitted by the SECs Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation (CD&I)
200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (CD&I 200.06) (formerly SEC Manual Telephone Interpretation 17.06). As permitted by CD&I 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide
reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criterion applicable to the vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply CD&I
200.06 for the vendor and related criterion as described in its Assertion of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Companys eligibility to apply CD&I 200.06. In our opinion, managements assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria, including criterion 1122(d)(2)(vi) for which
compliance is determined based on CD&I 200.06 as described above, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 is fairly stated, in all material respects. /s/ KPMG LLP Chicago, Illinois February 27, 2015 EX-35.1 7 d899646dex351.htm EX-35.1 EX-35.1 Exhibit 35.1 Servicer Compliance Statement of AmeriCredit Financial Services, Inc.
