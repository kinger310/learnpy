interconnected transistors on a single chip. Since the invention of the transistor in 1948, improvements in IC process and design technologies have led to the development of smaller, more complex and more reliable ICs at a lower cost-per-function. 3 Table of Contents Computing and Graphics The x86 Microprocessor and Chipset Markets Central Processing
Unit (CPU) . A microprocessor is an IC that serves as the CPU of a computer. It generally consists of hundreds of millions or billions of transistors that process data and control other devices in the system, acting as
the brain of the computer. The performance of a microprocessor is a critical factor impacting the performance of computing and entertainment platforms, such as desktop PCs, notebooks, tablets and workstations. The principal elements used
to measure CPU performance are work-per-cycle (or how many instructions are executed per cycle), clock speed (representing the rate at which a CPUs internal logic operates, measured in units of gigahertz, or billions of cycles per second) and
power consumption. Other factors impacting microprocessor performance include the number and type of cores in a microprocessor, the bit rating of the microprocessor, memory size and data access speed. Developments in IC design and manufacturing process technologies have resulted in significant advances in microprocessor performance. As
businesses and consumers require greater performance from their computer systems due to the growth of digital data and increasingly sophisticated software applications, semiconductor companies are designing and developing multi-core microprocessors,
where multiple processor cores are placed on a single die or in a single processor. Multi-core microprocessors offer enhanced overall system performance and efficiency because computing tasks can be spread across two or more processing cores, each
of which can execute a task at full speed. Multi-core microprocessors can increase performance of a computer system without greatly increasing the total amount of power consumed and the total amount of heat emitted. Businesses and consumers also
require computer systems with improved power management technology, which helps them to reduce the power consumption of their computer systems and lower total cost of ownership. Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) and System-on-Chip (SoC) . Consumers increasingly demand computing
devices, including desktop and notebooks PCs, and smaller form factors, such as tablets and 2-in-1s (PCs that can function both as a notebook or a tablet), with improved end-user experience, system performance and energy efficiency. Consumers also
continue to demand thinner and lighter mobile devices, with better performance and longer battery life. We believe that a computing architecture that optimizes the use of its components can provide these improvements. An APU is a processing unit that integrates a CPU and a GPU onto one chip (or one piece of silicon), along with, in some cases, other
special-purpose components. This integration enhances system performance by offloading selected tasks to the best-suited component (i.e., the CPU or the GPU) to optimize component use, increasing the speed of data flow between the CPU
and GPU through shared memory and allowing the GPU to function as both a graphics engine and an application accelerator. Having the CPU and GPU on the same chip also typically improves energy efficiency by, for example, eliminating connections
between discrete chips. An SoC is a type of IC with a CPU, GPU and other components, such as a memory controller and
peripheral management, comprising a complete computing system on a single chip. By combining all of these elements as an SoC, system performance and energy efficiency is improved, similar to an APU. Heterogeneous System Architecture (HSA) describes an industry standard that is an overarching design for having combinations of CPU and
GPU processor cores operate as a unified, integrated engine that shares system responsibilities and resources. We are a founding member of the HSA Foundation, a non-profit organization established to define and promote this open standards-based
approach to heterogeneous computing. Heterogeneous computing allows for the elevation of the GPU to the same level of the CPU for memory access, queuing and execution. In other words, rather than having a CPU as a master and other various processors
as subordinates, these CPU and GPU processing units can be referred to as compute cores (where each core is capable of running at least one process in its own context and virtual memory space, independently from other cores).
Heterogeneous computing also allows software programmers to develop applications that more fully utilize the full compute capabilities of APUs and SoCs. 4 Table of Contents Chipset. A chipset is a generic term referring to a
collection of system level components that manage data flow among a microprocessor or microprocessors, memory and peripherals (such as CD ROM drives, DVD drives and USB peripherals). Chipsets perform essential logic functions, balance a
systems performance and provide system control and power management functions. Some chipsets have graphics capabilities by including an integrated graphics processor (IGP) within the chipset. A chipset with an IGP is known as an IGP chipset.
IGP chipsets can offer a lower cost, reduced power alternative and are often also used in smaller form factors. Systems that are powered by an APU or by a CPU and discrete GPU combination often do not have a chipset and instead use an AMD Controller
Hub chip to perform the functions of a chipset. As a result, we believe that either an APU and AMD Controller Hub chip combination or an SoC, which already includes a chipset, will eventually replace the market for IGP chipsets. Our x86 Microprocessor and Chipset Products Our microprocessors are incorporated into computing platforms, which are a collection of technologies that are designed to work together to provide a more complete computing solution and to enable and
advance the computing components. We believe that integrated, balanced computing platforms consisting of microprocessors, chipsets and GPUs that work together at the system level bring end users improved system stability, increased performance and
enhanced power efficiency. In addition, we believe our customers also benefit from an all-AMD platform (consisting of an APU or CPU, a discrete GPU and a chipset or an AMD Fusion Controller Hub chip), as we are able to optimize interoperability,
provide them with a single point of contact for the key platform components and enable them to bring the platforms to market faster in a variety of client and server system form factors. We currently base our microprocessors and chipsets on the x86 instruction set architecture and AMDs Direct Connect Architecture,
which connects an on-chip memory controller and input/output (I/O) channels directly to one or more microprocessor cores. We typically integrate two or more processor cores onto a single die, and each core has its own dedicated cache, which is
memory that is located on the semiconductor die, permitting quicker access to frequently used data and instructions. Some of our microprocessors have additional levels of cache such as L2, or second-level cache, and L3, or third-level cache, to
enable faster data access and higher performance. We focus on continually improving the energy efficiency of our products
through our design principles and innovations in power management technology. To that end, we offer CPUs, GPUs, APUs, SoCs and chipsets with multiple low power states that utilize lower clock speeds and voltages to reduce processor power consumption
during active and idle times. The use of intelligent, dynamic power management is designed to create lower energy use by allowing compute applications to be completed quickly and efficiently, enabling a return to the ultra-low power idle state. Desktop. Our APUs for desktop PCs consist primarily of the AMD A-Series and AMD E-Series
APUs. We also offer AMD FX CPUs for the enthusiast market. In January 2014, we launched the AMD A10-7850K and A10-7700K, formerly codenamed Kaveri, for desktops. Kaveri is the worlds first APU to include HSA
features, AMD TrueAudio technology for improved fidelity and immersive audio and the HD gaming experience of AMDs Mantle application programming interface (API). Our Mantle API is designed to allow game developers to take greater advantage of
the full capability of our Graphic Core Next (GCN) architecture. Our GCN is our new approach to the design of a consumer GPU. In July 2014, we expanded our desktop AMD A-Series APU with the AMD A10-7800 APU, our high performance APU. We also
introduced the AMD A8-7600, AMD A6-7400K and AMD A4-7300 APUs, which are designed to allow consumers to upgrade their application and office experience on their desktop PC. The latest generation of our AMD FX CPUs is based on the
Piledriver x86 multi-core architecture. Our AMD FX CPUs are designed for multitasking, high resolution gaming and HD media processing and come in eight-, six- and quad-core versions. Notebook and 2-in-1s. In response to consumer demand, we continue to invest in designing and
developing high performing and low power notebook PC platforms. Our APUs for notebook PCs consist 5 Table of Contents primarily of performance AMD A-Series APUs and AMD E-Series APUs. These APUs combine discrete-level AMD Radeon graphics, dedicated HD video processing and multi-core CPU processors on a
single chip and are designed to maximize performance and energy efficiency. In April 2014, we announced our 2014 mainstream and low-power APUs and mobile APUs, formerly codenamed Beema and Mullins, respectively, which feature
up to four newly-designed x86 CPU cores with AMD Radeon graphics and a hardware-level data security solution based on the
ARM ® Cortex ® -A5, all on a single SoC. In June 2014, we introduced our 2014 Performance Mobile APUs, formerly codenamed Kaveri, designed for ultrathin and
high-performance mobile PCs. As part of the 2014 Performance Mobile APUs, we introduced the AMD FX APU designed for enthusiast-level performance for gaming and multitasking. Also, in June 2014, we announced our new AMD Pro A-Series APUs with HSA
features designed for commercial notebook PCs. Chipsets. Our portfolio of chipset
products includes chipsets with and without IGPs for desktop and notebook PCs and servers, as well as AMD Controller Hub-based chipsets for our APUs. We offer AMD 9-Series and AMD A88X, A85X, A78, A75, A68H,
A58 and A55 for desktop PCs, and we offer AMD A76M chipsets for notebook PCs. We also offer AMD 785E, SR5690, 780E and M690T chipsets for our embedded products. Graphics Market The semiconductor graphics market addresses the
need for improved visual processing in various computing devices. Many consumers value a rich visual experience to enable a more compelling and immersive experience, and, for these consumers, the PC is evolving from a traditional data processing and
communications device to an entertainment platform. As a result, visual realism and graphical display capabilities are key product differentiation elements among computing devices. This has led to increasing creation and use of processing-intensive
multimedia content for computing devices, including playing games, capturing TV and other multimedia content, viewing online videos, photo editing and managing digital content. In turn, these trends have contributed to higher consumer demand for
performance graphics solutions and manufacturers designing computing devices with these capabilities. Our APUs deliver visual
processing functionality for value and mainstream PCs by integrating a CPU and a GPU on a single chip, while discrete GPUs (which are also known as dedicated GPUs) are on a separate chip from the CPU and are specifically architected for higher
performance graphics processing. Heavy computational workloads have traditionally been processed on a CPU, but we believe that the industry is shifting to a new computing paradigm that increasingly relies more on a discrete GPU or an APU. AMD
Accelerated Parallel Processing or GPGPU (General Purpose GPU) refers to a set of advanced hardware and software technologies that enable discrete AMD GPUs, working in concert with the CPU, to accelerate applications beyond traditional graphics and
video processing by allowing the discrete GPU and the CPU to process information cooperatively. In addition, computing devices with HSA features run computationally-intensive tasks more efficiently, which we believe provides a superior application
experience to the end user. Our Graphics Products Our graphics products can be found in an APU, GPU, SoC or a combination of a GPU with one of the other foregoing
products working in tandem. Our customers generally use our graphics solutions to increase the speed of rendering images and to help improve image resolution and color definition. We develop our graphics products for use in various computing devices
and entertainment platforms, including desktop PCs, notebook PCs, 2-in-1s and professional workstations. With each of our graphics products, we have available drivers and supporting software packages that enable the effective use of these products
under a variety of operating systems and applications. In addition, our recent generation graphics products have
Linux ® driver support. Discrete Desktop Graphics . We offer discrete graphics products for gaming, multimedia, editing photos and videos as well as other graphic-intensive applications on
desktop platforms. Our discrete GPUs for desktop 6 Table of Contents PCs include the AMD Radeon R7 and R9 series, AMD Radeon HD 8000 series, AMD Radeon 7000 series and AMD Radeon HD 6000 series. In February 2014, we introduced two new additions to the
R7 seriesthe AMD Radeon R7 250X and R7 265. In March 2014, we added the AMD Radeon R9 280 to the R9 Series, and more recently in April 2014, we introduced the AMD Radeon R9 295X2, powered by two AMD Radeon R9 295 GPUs on a single card
designed for gamers and PC enthusiasts. All models of our AMD Radeon R7 and R9 series graphic cards support our Mantle API. Discrete Notebook Graphics. Our discrete GPUs for notebooks are designed to address graphics performance, visual experience, power efficiency, dedicated memory support
and ease of design integration, all of which are key considerations for notebook manufacturers. The AMD lineup of discrete GPUs for notebooks includes the AMD Radeon HD 7000M series and AMD Radeon HD 6000M series. In January 2014, we introduced the
AMD Radeon R9, R7 and R5 M200 Series, our new family of discrete GPUs for notebooks designed with support for Mantle API. Professional Graphics. Our AMD FirePro family of professional graphics products consists of 3D and 2D multi-view graphics cards and GPUs that we designed for
integration in mobile and desktop workstations, as well as commercial PCs. We designed our AMD FirePro 3D graphics cards for demanding applications, such as those found in the computer aided design (CAD) and digital content creation (DCC) markets,
with drivers specifically tuned for maximum performance, stability and reliability across a wide range of software packages. We designed our AMD FirePro 2D graphics cards with dual- and quad-display outputs for financial and corporate
environments. We also provide the AMD FirePro S-Series GPU products for the server market, where we target high
performance computing (HPC) and virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) use cases. In April 2014, we launched the AMD FirePro W9100 professional graphics cards for next-generation workstations with ultra-high resolution and multi-display capabilities.
In June 2014, we launched the AMD FirePro W8100 professional graphics card designed for the next generation 4K CAD and media and entertainment workflows, engineering analysis and supercomputing applications. In August 2014, we introduced new
additions to the next generation AMD FirePro professional graphics family, the AMD FirePro W2100, AMD FirePro W4100, AMD FirePro W5100 and AMD FirePro W7100. Additionally, we announced the AMD FirePro S9150 Server GPU in August 2014, designed for
large scale multi-GPU support and the AMD FirePro S9100 in October 2014, designed for high visualization, high throughput and multi-tasking. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom The Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom Markets Server. A server is a computer system that performs services for connected customers as part of a client-server architecture. Many servers are designed to run an
application or applications often for extended periods of time with minimal human intervention. Examples of servers include web servers, e-mail servers and print servers. These servers can run a variety of applications, including business
intelligence, enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management and advanced scientific or engineering models to solve advanced computational problems in disciplines ranging from financial modeling to weather forecasting to oil and gas
exploration. Servers are also used in cloud computing, which is a computing model where data, applications and services are delivered over the internet or an intranet. Todays data centers require new technologies and configuration models to
meet the demand driven by the staggering amount of data that needs to be stored, accessed and managed. Servers must be efficient, scalable and adaptable to meet the compute characteristics of new and changing workloads. Embedded . Embedded products address computing needs in PC-adjacent markets,
such as industrial control and automation, digital signage, point of sale/self-service kiosks, medical imaging, set-top box and casino gaming machines as well as enterprise class telecommunications, networking, security, storage systems and
thin clients (which are computers that serve as an access device on a network). Typically, our embedded products are used in applications that require high to moderate levels of performance, where key features may
include 7 Table of Contents mobility, relatively low power, small form factor, and 24x7 operations. High performance graphics are increasingly important in many embedded systems. Support for Linux,
Windows and other operating systems as well as for increasingly sophisticated applications are also critical for some customers. Other requirements may include meeting rigid specifications for industrial temperatures, shock, vibration and
reliability. The embedded market has moved from developing proprietary, custom designs to leveraging industry-standard instruction set architectures and processors as a way to help reduce costs and speed time to market. Semi-Custom . We have leveraged our core IP, including our graphics and
processing technologies developed for the PC market, to develop semi-custom solutions for customers who want differentiation in their products, including todays leading game console manufacturers. In this market, semiconductor suppliers work
alongside game console manufacturers to enhance the visual performance and overall user experience for game console customers. This same type of collaborative development approach can also address customer needs in many other markets beyond game
consoles, leveraging our existing IP to create a variety of products tailored to a specific customers needs, ranging from complex fully-customized SoCs to more modest adaptations and integrations of existing CPU, APU or GPU products. Our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom Products Server Processors. Our microprocessors for server platforms currently include:  The AMD
Opteron TM X-Series includes small-core x86 APUs and CPUs
that are ideal for next-generation scale-out Web and cloud applications ranging from big data analytics to image processing, multimedia content delivery and hosting.  AMD Opteron 6300 Series processors, which are designed to meet the demanding performance per-watt, per-dollar requirements that are at the heart of
server buying decisions. The AMD Opteron 6338P (12 core) and 6370P (16 core) processors are optimized to handle the heavily virtualized workloads found in enterprise environments. These processors feature the Piledriver core and are
fully socket and software compatible with the existing AMD Opteron 6300 Series. During 2014, we began
sampling the AMD Opteron A1100 Series processor, our first 64-bit ARM-based server processor based on 28nm technology. AMD Opteron A-Series processors combine AMDs expertise in delivering server-class silicon with ARMs trademark
low-power architecture. These products are designed to bring the experience and technology portfolio of an established server processor vendor to the ARM ecosystem and complement our AMD Opteron x86 server processors. The first AMD Opteron A-Series
processors are expected to launch later in 2015. Dense Server Systems. In addition, to
offering microprocessors for servers, we offer dense server systems, designed to reduce power consumption and improve space efficiency for data centers. Our dense server products currently include the SeaMicro SM15000 server, as well as the
SeaMicro Freedom Fabric Storage series of storage enclosures. SeaMicro dense servers incorporate our proprietary fabric technology, the Freedom supercomputer fabric, which interconnects hundreds of card-sized motherboards, eliminating
top-of-rack switches, terminal servers, hundreds of cables and thousands of unnecessary components for a more efficient and simple operational environment. We designed this fabric to reduce data center power consumption while providing low latency
and higher bandwidth interconnections. Embedded Processors . Our embedded
processors are increasingly driving intelligence into new areas of our lives, from smart TVs and set-top boxes to interactive digital signage, casino gaming, and medical imaging. These products are designed to support greater connectivity and
productivity, and we believe they are a strong driver for the internet of things and surround computing areas in the computing industry. Our processor products for embedded platforms include the following:  Our second generation AMD Embedded R-Series APU and CPU launched in May 2014, formerly codenamed Bald Eagle, supports HSA and was designed
for processing performance, power 8 Table of Contents efficiency and multimedia immersion in mid-to high-end visual and parallel compute-intensive embedded applications.  The AMD Embedded G-Series SoC platform is a high-performance, low-power design offering ultra-low power
consumption and advanced graphics performance. In June 2014, we announced our AMD Embedded G-Series SoC, formerly codenamed Steppe Eagle, designed for rugged and harsh environments such as ATMs, kiosks, automation, medical equipment and
gaming machines. Also in June 2014, we introduced another AMD Embedded G-Series CPU, formerly codenamed Crowned Eagle, for networking and communications infrastructure applications that require high performance at low cost and low power.  The AMD Embedded Radeon E-Series GPU family includes a broad array of discrete GPU products designed to provide immersive graphics and enhanced
parallel compute capabilities for the embedded market. The AMD Embedded Radeon E8860 GPU is the industrys first discrete graphics card for embedded applications based on GCN architecture, delivering 3D and 4K graphics to embedded gaming
machines, digital signage, medical imaging, commercial aerospace, and other embedded applications. In
October 2014, we began sampling our first 64-bit ARM Cortex-A57-based AMD Embedded R-Series SoC, codenamed Hierofalcon. The AMD Embedded R-Series SoC platform is designed for embedded data center applications, communications
infrastructure and industrial solutions and is expected to ship in the first half of 2015. Semi-Custom. Our semi-custom products are tailored, high-performance
customer-specific solutions based on AMDs CPU, GPU and multi-media technologies. We work closely together with our customers to define solutions to precisely match the requirements of the device or application. Historically we have
leveraged our core graphics processing technology into the game console market by licensing our graphic technology in game consoles such as the Microsoft ® Xbox 360 and Nintendo Wii and Wii U. In the fourth quarter of 2013, Sony launched its Sony Playstation ® 4 and Microsoft launched its
Microsoft ® Xbox One. Both of these next-generation game consoles are powered by AMD semi-custom SoC
products. Marketing and Sales We sell our products through our direct sales force and through independent distributors and sales representatives in both domestic and international markets. Our sales arrangements generally operate on
the basis of product forecasts provided by the particular customer, but do not typically include any commitment or requirement for minimum product purchases. We primarily use purchase orders, sales order acknowledgments and contractual
agreements as evidence of our sales arrangements. Our agreements typically contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as payment terms, warranties and indemnities for issues specific to our products. We generally warrant that our products sold to our customers will conform to our approved specifications and be free from defects in
material and workmanship under normal use and service for one year. Subject to certain exceptions, we also offer a three-year limited warranty to end users for only those CPU and AMD A-Series APU products
purchased as individually packaged products, commonly referred to as processors in a box and for PC workstation products. We have also offered extended limited warranties to certain customers of tray microprocessor products
for each of our business units and/or workstation graphics products who have written agreements with us and target their computer systems at the commercial and/or embedded markets. We market and sell our latest products under the AMD trademark and some legacy graphics products under the ATI trademark. Our desktop PC
product brands for microprocessors are AMD A-Series, AMD E-Series, AMD FX CPU, AMD Athlon CPU and APU and AMD Sempron APU and CPU. Our notebook and 2-in-1s for microprocessors are AMD A-Series, AMD E-Series, AMD C-Series, AMD Z-Series, AMD FX APU,
AMD Phenom, AMD Athlon CPU and APU, AMD Turion and AMD Sempron APU and CPU. Our server brand for 9 Table of Contents microprocessors is AMD Opteron. We sell dense server systems products under the SeaMicro brand, including the SM15000 series and Freedom Fabric Storage series for storage systems. We also sell
low-power versions of our AMD Opteron, AMD Athlon and AMD Sempron, as well as AMD Geode, AMD R-Series and G-Series processors as embedded processor solutions. Our product brand for the consumer graphics market is AMD Radeon. Our product brand for
professional graphics products is AMD FirePro. We also market and sell our chipsets under the AMD trademark. We market our
products through our direct marketing and co-marketing programs. In addition, we have cooperative advertising and marketing programs with customers and third parties, including market development programs, pursuant to which we may provide product
information, training, marketing materials and funds. Under our co-marketing development programs, eligible customers can use market development funds as reimbursement for advertisements and marketing programs related to our products and third-party
systems integrating our products, subject to meeting defined criteria. Customers Our microprocessor customers consist primarily of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), original design manufacturers (ODMs), system
builders and independent distributors in both domestic and international markets. ODMs provide design and/or manufacturing services to branded and unbranded private label resellers, OEMs and system builders. Our graphics product customers include
the foregoing as well as add-in-board manufacturers (AIBs). Customers of our chipset products consist primarily of PC and
server OEMs, often through ODMs or other contract manufacturers, who build the OEM motherboards, as well as desktop and server motherboard manufacturers who incorporate chipsets into their channel motherboards. We work closely with our customers to define product features, performance and timing of new products so that the products we are
developing meet our customers needs. We also employ application engineers to assist our customers in designing, testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our products. We believe that our commitment to customer service and design
support improves our customers time-to-market and fosters relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of our products. We work closely with our customers to create differentiated products that leverage our CPU, GPU and APU technology. In some cases, customers of our semi-custom products pay us non-recurring engineering
fees for design and development services and a purchase price for the resulting semi-custom products. Collectively, our top
five customers accounted for approximately 61% of our net revenue during the year ended 2014. In 2014, Hewlett-Packard Company, Microsoft Corporation and Sony Corporation each accounted for more than 13% of our consolidated net revenues. Sales to
Hewlett-Packard consisted primarily of products from our Computing and Graphics segment. Sales to Microsoft and Sony consisted primarily of products from our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Five customers, including Hewlett-Packard,
accounted for approximately 54% of the net revenue attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment. In addition, five customers, including Sony, Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, accounted for approximately 90% of the net revenue attributable to our
Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. A loss of any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our business. Original Equipment Manufacturers We focus on three types of OEM customers: multi-nationals, selected regional accounts and target market customers. Large multi-nationals and regional accounts are our core OEM customers. Our OEM customers
include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of servers and workstations, desktops, notebooks, PC motherboards and game consoles. 10 Table of Contents Third-Party Distributors Our authorized channel distributors resell to sub-distributors and mid-sized and smaller OEMs and ODMs. Typically, distributors handle a
wide variety of products, including those that compete with our products. Distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price
reductions and provide return rights with respect to any product that we have removed from our price book that is not more than 12 months older than the manufacturing code date. In addition, some agreements with our distributors may contain standard
stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Add-in-Board (AIB) Manufacturers and System Integrators We offer component-level graphics and chipset products to AIB manufacturers who in turn build and sell board-level
products using our technology to system integrators (SIs), and to retail buyers. Our agreements with AIBs protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. We also sell directly to our SI customers. SIs typically sell from positions
of regional or product-based strength in the market. They usually operate on short design cycles and can respond quickly with new technologies. SIs often use discrete graphics solutions as a means to differentiate their products and add value to
their customers. Competition Generally, the IC industry is intensely competitive. Products typically compete on timely product introductions, product quality (including enabling state-of-the art visual experiences), power consumption
(including battery life), reliability, processor clock speed, performance, size (or form factor), selling, price, cost, adherence to industry standards (and the creation of open industry standards), level of integration, software and hardware
compatibility and stability, brand recognition and availability. Technological advances in the industry result in frequent product introductions, regular price reductions and short product life cycles for some products, and increased product
capabilities that may result in significant performance improvements. Our ability to compete depends on our ability to develop, introduce and sell new products or enhanced versions of existing products on a timely basis and at competitive prices,
while reducing our costs. Competition in the Microprocessor and Chipset Market Intel Corporation has been the market share leader for microprocessors for many years. Intels market share, margins and significant
financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to influence customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities have in the past and are
likely in the future to result in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for many of our products and adversely affect our margins and profitability. As long as Intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by Intels:  business practices, including rebating and allocation strategies and pricing actions, designed to limit our market share and margins;  product mix and introduction schedules;  product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies;  exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers and channel partners;  control over industry standards, PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants, including motherboard, memory, chipset and basic input/output
system, or BIOS, suppliers and software companies as well as the graphics interface for Intel platforms; and  marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the Intel brand over the brand of its OEM customers. Intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and other
marketing programs. As a result of Intels position in the microprocessor market, Intel 11 Table of Contents has been able to control x86 microprocessor and computer system standards and benchmarks and to dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of us. Intel also dominates the
computer system platform, which includes core logic chipsets, graphics chips, motherboards and other components necessary to assemble a computer system. OEMs that purchase microprocessors for computer systems are highly dependent on Intel, less
innovative on their own and, to a large extent, are distributors of Intel technology. Additionally, Intel is able to drive de facto standards and specifications for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access
to such standards. Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially
greater amounts on marketing and research and development than we do. We expect Intel to maintain its market position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology
companies. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to
Intels aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products. For example, Intel recently introduced microprocessors for low-cost notebooks, similar to products that we offer for low-cost notebooks. Intels position in the microprocessor market and IGP chipset market, its introduction of competitive new products, its existing
relationships with top-tier OEMs and its aggressive marketing and pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Other competitors include a variety of companies providing or developing ARM-based designs at relatively low cost and low power
processors for the computing market including netbooks, tablets and thin-client form factors, as well as dense servers, set-top boxes and gaming consoles. ARM Holdings designs and licenses its ARM architecture to third parties, including us, and
offers supporting software and services. Our ability to compete with companies who use ARM-based solutions depends on our ability to timely design and bring to market energy-efficient, high-performing products at an attractive price point. In the chipset market, our competitors include suppliers of IGP chipsets. PC manufacturers use IGP chipsets because they cost
less than traditional discrete GPUs while offering acceptable graphics performance for most mainstream PC users. Intel also leverages its dominance in the microprocessor market to sell its IGP chipsets. Intel manufactures and sells IGP chipsets
bundled with their microprocessors and is our main competitor in this market. Competition in the Graphics Markets In the graphics market, our competitors include suppliers of discrete graphics, embedded graphics processors and IGP chipsets. Intel
manufactures and sells embedded graphics processors and IGP chipsets, and is a dominant competitor with respect to this portion of our business. Higher unit shipments of our APUs and Intels integrated graphics may drive computer manufacturers
to reduce the number of systems they build paired with discrete graphics components, particularly for notebooks, because they may offer satisfactory graphics performance for most mainstream PC users, at a lower cost. Intel could take actions that
place our discrete GPUs and IGP chipsets at a competitive disadvantage such as giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics market, such as Nvidia Corporation, preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful
information. Our principal competitor in the graphics market is Nvidia. AMD and Nvidia are the two principal players offering
discrete graphics solutions. Other competitors include a number of smaller companies, which may have greater flexibility to address specific market needs, but less financial resources to do so, especially as we believe that the growing
complexity of graphics processors and the associated research and development costs represent an increasingly higher barrier to entry in this market. In the semi-custom game console products, where graphics performance is critical, we compete
against primarily Nvidia, and also compete against Imagination Technology Group. 12 Table of Contents Research and Development We focus our research and development activities on improving and enhancing product design. One main area of focus is on delivering the next generation of products with greater system level integration of
the CPU and GPU and transforming our products into SoCs, with, in each case, improved system performance and performance-per-watt characteristics. For example, we are focusing on improving the battery life of our microprocessors and APU products for
notebooks and the power efficiency of our microprocessors for servers. We are also focusing on delivering a range of low-power integrated platforms to serve key markets, including commercial clients, mobile computing and gaming and media computing,
as well as developing an HSA, which is designed for software developers to easily program APUs by combining scalar processing on the CPU with parallel processing on the GPU, all while providing high bandwidth access to memory at low power. We
believe that these integrated platforms will bring customers better time-to-market and increased performance and energy efficiency. We also work with industry leaders on process technology, software and other functional intellectual property and we
work with others in the industry, public foundations, universities and industry consortia to conduct early stage research and development. Our research and development expenses for 2014, 2013 and 2012 were approximately $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. For more information, see Part II,
Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, below. We
conduct product and system research and development activities for our products in the United States with additional design and development engineering teams located in China, Canada, India, Singapore, Taiwan and Israel. Manufacturing Arrangements and Assembly and Test Facilities Third-Party Wafer Foundry Facilities GLOBALFOUNDRIES
Inc. On March 2, 2009, we entered into a Wafer Supply Agreement (the WSA) with GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF). The WSA governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF, a related party to us. Pursuant
to the WSA, we are required to purchase all of our microprocessor and APU product requirements from GF with limited exceptions. For more information about the WSA, see Part II, Item 7-Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations-GLOBALFOUNDRIES, below. GF currently manufactures wafers for our products on 300 millimeter wafers primarily in technologies ranging from 32nm to 28nm. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company . We also have foundry arrangements with Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) for the production of wafers for certain products. We are in production in TSMCs 300 millimeter fabrication facilities in technologies ranging from 65nm to 28nm. Other Third-Party Manufacturers . We outsource board-level graphics product manufacturing to
third-party manufacturers. We also outsource board-level and system-level product manufacturing to third-party manufacturers for our SeaMicro dense server and storage products. Assembly, Test, Mark and Packaging Facilities We own and operate
two assembly, test, mark and packaging facilities. Some wafers for our products are delivered from third-party foundries to our assembly, test, mark and packaging facilities. Our assembly, test, mark and packaging facilities are described in the
chart set forth below: Facility Location Approximate Manufacturing Area Square Footage Activity Penang, Malaysia 150,000 Assembly, Test, Mark & Packaging Suzhou, China 100,000 Assembly, Test, Mark & Packaging 13 Table of Contents The remaining wafers for our products are delivered from third-party foundries to our test,
assembly and packaging partners located in the Asia-Pacific region who package and test our final semiconductor products. Intellectual
Property and Licensing We rely on contracts and intellectual property rights to protect our products and technologies from
unauthorized third-party copying and use. Intellectual property rights include copyrights, patents, patent applications, trademarks, trade secrets and maskwork rights. As of December 27, 2014, we had approximately 4,900 patents in the United
States and approximately 1,200 patent applications pending in the United States. In certain cases, we have filed corresponding applications in foreign jurisdictions. We expect to file future patent applications in both the United States and abroad
on significant inventions, as we deem appropriate. We do not believe that any individual patent, or the expiration of any patent, is or would be material to our business. As is typical in the semiconductor industry, we have numerous cross-licensing and technology exchange agreements with other companies under which we both transfer and receive technology and intellectual
property rights. One such agreement is the cross license agreement that we entered into with Intel on November 11, 2009. Under the cross license agreement, we granted to Intel and Intel granted to us, non-exclusive, royalty-free licenses
to all of each others patents that were first filed no later than November 11, 2014 and each party can exploit these patents anywhere in the world for making and selling certain semiconductor- and electronic-related products. Under the
cross license agreement, Intel has rights to make semiconductor products for third parties, but the third-party product designs are not licensed as a result of such manufacture. We have rights to perform assembly and testing for third parties
but not rights to make semiconductor products for third parties. The term of the cross license agreement continues until the expiration of the last to expire of the licensed patents, unless earlier terminated. A party can terminate the
cross license agreement or the rights and licenses of the other party if the other party materially breaches the cross license agreement and does not correct the noticed material breach within 60 days. Upon such termination, the terminated
partys license rights terminate but the terminating partys license rights continue, subject to that partys continued compliance with the terms of the cross license agreement. The cross license agreement will automatically
terminate if a party undergoes a change of control (as defined in the cross license agreement), and both parties licenses will terminate. Upon the bankruptcy of a party, that party may assume, but may not assign, the cross license
agreement, and in the event that the cross license agreement cannot be assumed, the cross license agreement and the licenses granted will terminate. Backlog Sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current
delivery or agreements covering purchases over a period of time. Some of these orders or agreements may be revised or canceled without penalty. Generally, in light of current industry practice, we do not believe that such orders or agreements
provide meaningful backlog figures or are necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period. Seasonality Our operating results tend to vary seasonally. For example, historically, first quarter PC product sales are generally lower than fourth
quarter sales. In addition, with respect to our semi-custom SoC products for game consoles, we expect sales patterns to follow the seasonal trends of a consumer business with sales in the first half of the year being lower than sales in the second
half of the year. Employees As of December 27, 2014, we had approximately 9,700 employees. Environmental Regulations Many aspects of our business operations and products are regulated by domestic and international environmental laws and
regulations. These regulations include limitations on discharge of pollutants to air, water, 14 Table of Contents and soil; remediation requirements; product chemical content limitations; manufacturing chemical use and handling restrictions; pollution control requirements; waste minimization considerations;
and requirements with respect to treatment, transport, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. If we fail to comply with any applicable environmental regulations, we may be subject to fines, suspension of production, alteration of our
manufacturing processes, import/export restrictions, sales limitations and/or criminal and civil liabilities. Existing or future regulations could require us to procure expensive pollution abatement or remediation equipment, to modify product
designs or to incur other expenses to comply with environmental regulations. Any failure to adequately control the use, disposal, storage or discharge of hazardous substances could expose us to future liabilities that could have a material adverse
effect on our business. We believe we are in material compliance with applicable environmental requirements and do not expect those requirements to result in material expenditures in the foreseeable future. Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. For example, the European Union
(EU) and China are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted restrictions on the use of lead and other materials in electronic products. These regulations affect semiconductor devices and packaging. As regulations restricting
materials in electronic products continue to increase around the world, there is a risk that the cost, quality and manufacturing yields of products that are subject to these restrictions, may be less favorable compared to products that are not
subject to such restrictions, or that the transition to compliant products may not meet customer road maps, or produce sudden changes in demand, which may result in excess inventory. A number of jurisdictions including the EU, Australia and China
are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulations for computers and servers based on ENERGY STAR specifications as well as additional energy consumption limits. There is the potential for certain of our products being
excluded from some of these markets which could materially adversely affect us. Recent U.S. legislation includes disclosure
and reporting requirements for companies who use conflict minerals that originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries. We will likely incur additional costs associated with complying with these requirements, such
as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products, auditing the process and reporting to our customers and the U.S. government. Also, since our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges if we
are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the subject minerals. Moreover, we are likely to encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict free. If
we cannot satisfy these customers, they may choose a competitors products. A number of jurisdictions including the EU,
Australia and China are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulations for computers and servers based on ENERGY STAR specifications as well as additional energy consumption limits. There is the potential for certain of
our products being excluded from some of these markets which could materially adversely affect us. While we have budgeted for
foreseeable associated expenditures, we cannot assure you that future environmental legal requirements will not become more stringent or costly in the future. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future
environmental and health and safety laws, and our liabilities arising from past and future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances will not have a material adverse effect on us. See also, Item 3-Legal Proceedings-Environmental
Matters, below. 15 Table of Contents ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The
risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, you should consider
the interrelationship and compounding effects of two or more risks occurring simultaneously. Intel Corporations dominance of
the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit our ability to compete effectively. Intel
Corporation has been the market share leader for microprocessors for many years. Intels market share, margins and significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners
with special incentives and to influence customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities have in the past and are likely in the future to result in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for many of our products and
adversely affect our margins and profitability. As long as Intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially
adversely affected by Intels:  business practices, including rebating and allocation strategies and pricing actions, designed to limit our market share and margins;  product mix and introduction schedules;  product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies;  exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers and channel partners;  control over industry standards, PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants, including motherboard, memory, chipset and basic input/output
system, or BIOS, suppliers and software companies as well as the graphics interface for Intel platforms; and  marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the Intel brand over the brand of its OEM customers. Intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and other
marketing programs. As a result of Intels position in the microprocessor market, Intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and computer system standards and benchmarks and to dictate the type of products the microprocessor market
requires of us. Intel also dominates the computer system platform, which includes core logic chipsets, graphics chips, motherboards and other components necessary to assemble a computer system. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) that purchase
microprocessors for computer systems are highly dependent on Intel, less innovative on their own and, to a large extent, are distributors of Intel technology. Additionally, Intel is able to drive de facto standards and specifications for
x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards. Intel has
substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on marketing and research and development than we do. We expect Intel to maintain its market position and to continue to invest heavily in
marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces
competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intels aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products. For example, Intel recently introduced microprocessors for low-cost notebooks,
similar to products that we offer for low-cost notebooks. Intel could also take actions that place our discrete GPUs at a
competitive disadvantage, including giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics market, such as Nvidia Corporation, preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information. 16 Table of Contents Intels position in the microprocessor market and integrated graphics chipset market,
its introduction of competitive new products, its existing relationships with top-tier OEMs and its aggressive marketing and pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for our products, which could have a
material adverse effect on us. We rely on GF to manufacture most of our microprocessor and APU products and certain of our GPU and
semi-custom products. If GF is not able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements, our business could be adversely impacted. The WSA governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF. Pursuant to the WSA, we are required to purchase all of our microprocessor and APU product requirements from GF with limited
exceptions. If GF is unable to achieve anticipated manufacturing yields, remain competitive using or implementing advanced leading-edge process technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products, manufacture our products on a
timely basis at competitive prices or meet our capacity requirements, then we may experience delays in product launches, supply shortages for certain products or increased costs and our business could be materially adversely affected. Further, if our requirements are less than the number of wafers that we may commit to purchase from GF, we could have excess inventory or
higher inventory unit costs, both of which will adversely impact our gross margin and our results of operations. We are
currently in the process of negotiating a fifth amendment to the WSA, and we expect that our future purchases from GF will continue to be material. If we do not successfully conclude our negotiations, it could have a material adverse impact on our
gross margin and our results of operations. In addition, GF has relied on Mubadala Technology Investments LLC (Mubadala
Tech), formerly known as Advanced Technology Investment Company, for its funding needs. If Mubadala Tech fails to adequately fund GF on a timely basis, or at all, GFs ability to manufacture products for us could be materially adversely
affected. We rely on third parties to manufacture our products, and if they are unable to do so on a timely basis in sufficient
quantities and using competitive technologies, our business could be materially adversely affected. We rely on
third-party wafer foundries to fabricate the silicon wafers for all of our products. We also rely on third-party manufacturers to assemble, test, mark and pack certain of our products. It is important to have reliable relationships with all of these
third-party manufacturing suppliers to ensure adequate product supply to respond to customer demand. We cannot assure you
that these manufacturers or our other third-party manufacturing suppliers will be able to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements. If we experience supply constraints from our third-party manufacturing suppliers, we may be
required to allocate the affected products amongst our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with these customers and on our financial condition. In addition, if we are unable to meet customer demand due to
fluctuating or late supply from our manufacturing suppliers, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business. We do not have long-term commitment contracts with some of our third-party manufacturing suppliers. We obtain some of these manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not
required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an existing purchase order. Accordingly, we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our
needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices. The manufacturers we use also fabricate wafers and assemble, test and package
products for other companies, including certain of our competitors. They could choose to prioritize capacity for other users, increase the prices that they charge us on short notice or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business. 17 Table of Contents Other risks associated with our dependence on third-party manufacturers include limited
control over delivery schedules and quality assurance, lack of capacity in periods of excess demand, misappropriation of our intellectual property, dependence on several small undercapitalized subcontractors and limited ability to manage inventory
and parts. Moreover, if any of our third-party manufacturers suffer any damage to facilities, lose benefits under material agreements, experience power outages, lack sufficient capacity to manufacture our products, encounter financial difficulties,
are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers or suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions. If we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of products, our
ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business. If we transition the
production of some of our products to new manufacturers, we may experience delayed product introductions, lower yields or poorer performance of our products. If we experience problems with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity
from a particular third-party manufacturer, or if we for other reasons cease utilizing one of those suppliers, we may be unable to secure an alternative supply for any specific product in a short time frame. We could experience significant delays in
the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third-party manufacturers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for our products could negatively impact our financial results. Semiconductor manufacturing yields are a result of both product design and process technology, which is typically proprietary to the manufacturer, and low yields can result from design failures, process
technology failures or a combination of both. Our third-party foundries, including GF, are responsible for the process technologies used to fabricate silicon wafers. If our third-party foundries experience manufacturing inefficiencies or encounter
disruptions, errors or difficulties during production, we may fail to achieve acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays. We cannot be certain that our third-party foundries will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement
leading-edge process technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products profitably or on a timely basis or that our competitors will not develop new technologies, products or processes earlier. Moreover, during periods when
foundries are implementing new process technologies, their manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive. A substantial delay in the technology transitions to smaller process technologies could have a material adverse effect on us,
particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies before us. Any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in per unit costs, which would adversely impact our gross margin and/or force us to allocate
our reduced product supply amongst our customers, which could harm our relationships with our customers and reputation and materially adversely affect our business. The success of our business is dependent upon our ability to introduce products on a timely basis with features and performance levels that provide value to our customers while supporting and
coinciding with significant industry transitions. Our success depends to a significant extent on the development,
qualification, implementation and acceptance of new product designs and improvements that provide value to our customers. Our ability to develop, qualify and distribute, and have manufactured, new products and related technologies to meet evolving
industry requirements, at prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target markets. For example, form factors continue to shift from desktop PCs and notebooks to
tablets. Historically, a significant portion of our Computing and Graphics revenue has been related to desktop PCs. As consumers adopt new form factors, have new product feature preferences or have different requirements than those consumers in the
PC market, PC sales could be negatively impacted, which could negatively impact our business. Currently, a large portion of our business is focused on the consumer PC portions of the market, which has experienced a decline driven by the adoption of
smaller form factors and increased competition. If we fail to or are delayed in developing, qualifying or shipping new products or 18 Table of Contents technologies that provide value to our customers and address these new trends or if we fail to predict which new form factors consumers will adopt, we may lose competitive positioning, which
could cause us to lose market share and require us to discount the selling prices of our products. Although we make substantial investments in research and development, we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully
implement new products and technologies on a timely basis. Delays in developing, qualifying or shipping new products can also
cause us to miss our customers product design windows or, in some cases, breach contractual obligations or cause us to pay penalties. If our customers do not include our products in the initial design of their computer systems or products,
they will typically not use our products in their systems or products until at least the next design configuration. The process of being qualified for inclusion in a customers system or product can be lengthy and could cause us to further miss
a cycle in the demand of end-users, which also could result in a loss of market share and harm our business. Moreover, market
demand requires that products incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry-wide basis. Over the life of a specific product, the sale price is typically reduced over time. The introduction of new products and enhancements to
existing products is necessary to maintain the overall corporate average selling price. If we are unable to introduce new products with sufficiently high sale prices or to increase unit sales volumes capable of offsetting the reductions in the sale
prices of existing products over time, our business could be materially adversely affected. If we cannot generate sufficient revenue
and operating cash flow or obtain external financing, we may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of our planned investments in research and development or other strategic investments. Our ability to fund research and development expenditures depends on generating sufficient revenue and cash flow from operations and the
availability of external financing, if necessary. Our research and development expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. If new competitors, technological
advances by existing competitors or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. If we are required to invest
significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue, our operating results could decline. We regularly assess markets for external financing opportunities, including debt and equity financing. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or, if available, may not be
available on satisfactory terms. The health of the credit markets may adversely impact our ability to obtain financing when needed. Any downgrades from credit rating agencies such as Moodys or Standard & Poors may adversely
impact our ability to obtain external financing or the terms of such financing. In addition, credit agency downgrades or concerns regarding our credit worthiness may impact relationships with our suppliers, who may limit our credit lines. Our
inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail planned investments in research and development or other strategic initiatives. If we curtail planned investments in
research and development or abandon projects, our products may fail to remain competitive and our business would be materially adversely affected. We may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy to refocus our business to address markets beyond our core PC market to high-growth adjacent markets. We are implementing a business strategy to refocus our business to address markets beyond our core PC market to high-growth adjacent
markets, representing the embedded, professional graphics, semi-custom, dense server and ultra low-power client markets. One of the goals of our strategy is to derive approximately 50% of our revenue from high growth adjacent markets by the end of
2015. As part of our business strategy, effective July 1, 2014, we realigned our organizational structure to create a Computing and Graphics segment and an Enterprise, 19 Table of Contents Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. However, if demand for products from high growth adjacent markets is below our expectations or if we are not able to improve cost or operational efficiencies of
this business model, we may not realize benefits from our business strategy. Despite our efforts, we may not be able to effectively implement our strategy in a timely manner to exploit potential market opportunities, achieve the goals of our
business strategy or meet competitive challenges. Moreover, our business strategy is dependent on creating products that
anticipate customer requirements and emerging industry trends. For example, throughout 2014, we sampled Seattle, our first 64-bit ARM server processor and in the second quarter of 2014, we announced a 64-bit ARM architectural license for
the development of custom high-performance cores for high-growth adjacent markets. Also in the second quarter of 2014 we announced our third generation mainstream and low powered mobile APUs, formerly codenamed Mullins and
Beema, and we released our new embedded APU, formerly codenamed Bald Eagle, which is our first embedded processor to incorporate HSA features. We cannot assure you that our new strategic direction, including our efforts to
address markets beyond our core PC market and our efforts to create ARM-based products, will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers. In addition, we may be entering markets where current and new
competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirements and emerging technologies. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitors who may have stronger positions in these new
markets. We may face delays or disruptions in research and development efforts, or we may be required to significantly invest greater resources in research and development than anticipated. The completion and impact of the 2014 Restructuring Plan and our transformation initiatives could adversely affect us. In October 2014, we implemented a restructuring plan (the 2014 Restructuring Plan) designed to improve operating efficiencies. The 2014
Restructuring Plan involved a reduction of global headcount by approximately 6%, largely completed by the end of 2014, and an alignment of our real estate footprint with the reduced headcount, largely expected to be completed by the end of the first
half of 2015. These restructuring actions could have an adverse impact on our business as a result of decreases in employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees. We cannot be sure that we will realize
operational savings or any other benefits from the 2014 Restructuring Plan. Any operating savings are subject to assumptions, estimates and significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. If these
estimates and assumptions are incorrect, if we experience delays or if other unforeseen events occur, our business and financial results could be adversely affected. In addition, as a result of the 2014 Restructuring Plan, we recorded a
restructuring and impairment charge of $57 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, and we expect to record a restructuring charge of approximately $13 million in 2015, primarily related to real estate actions. We also made cash payments related to
the 2014 Restructuring Plan of $19 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and expect to make cash payments related to the 2014 Restructuring Plan of approximately $34 million in 2015 and approximately $8 million in 2016. Global economic uncertainty may adversely impact our business and operating results. Uncertain global economic conditions have in the past and may in the future adversely impact our business. Uncertainty in the worldwide
economic environment may negatively impact consumer confidence and spending causing our customers to postpone purchases. In addition, during challenging economic times, our current or potential future customers may experience cash flow problems and
as a result may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products. Additionally, if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are unable to secure financing, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of,
accounts receivable that they owe us. The risk related to our customers potentially defaulting on or delaying payments to us is increased because we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of our
revenue. Any inability of our current or potential future customers to pay us for our products may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow. Moreover, our key suppliers may reduce their output or become insolvent, 20 Table of Contents thereby adversely impacting our ability to manufacture our products. In addition, uncertain economic conditions may make it more difficult for us to raise funds through borrowings or private or
public sales of debt or equity securities. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations or meet our
working capital requirements. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt will depend on our financial
and operating performance, which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will
be able to generate cash flow or that we will be able to borrow funds, including under our senior secured asset based line of credit for a principal amount up to $500 million (our Secured Revolving Line of Credit, as amended), in amounts sufficient
to enable us to service our debt or to meet our working capital requirements. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds to service our debt, we may be required to sell assets or equity, reduce
expenditures, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our debt, sell assets or equity, borrow funds under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit or borrow
more funds on terms acceptable to us, if at all. We have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our
financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations. Our total
debt as of December 27, 2014 was $2.2 billion. Our substantial indebtedness may:  make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments;  limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes;  limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general
corporate purposes;  require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments;  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and  increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions. We enter into interest rate swap agreements from time to time to manage our exposure to interest rate risk. These swap agreements involve
risks, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, the risk that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates and the risk that our exposure to
interest rates may increase if interest rates increase. The agreements governing our notes and our Secured Revolving Line of Credit
impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business. The indentures governing our
7.75% Senior Notes due 2020 (7.75% Notes), 7.50% Senior Notes due 2022 (7.50% Notes), 7.00% Senior Notes due 2024 (7.00% Notes) and 6.75% Senior Notes due 2019 (6.75% Notes) contain various covenants which limit our ability to, among other things:  incur additional indebtedness;  pay dividends and make other restricted payments;  make certain investments, including investments in our unrestricted subsidiaries; 21 Table of Contents  create or permit certain liens;  create or permit restrictions on the ability of certain restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us;  use the proceeds from sales of assets;  enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates; and  consolidate or merge or sell our assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety. Our Secured Revolving Line of Credit also contains various covenants which limit our ability to, among other things, make certain
investments, merge or consolidate with other entities and permit certain subsidiaries from incurring indebtedness. In addition, during a domestic cash trigger period (a Domestic Cash Trigger Period), which occurs (i) upon an event of default or
(ii) when the amount of domestic cash or cash equivalents held in certain accounts is at any time less than $250 million, and ends when both (a) no event of default has existed for 45 days and (b) the amount of domestic cash or
cash equivalents held in such accounts has been equal to or greater than $250 million for 45 days, we will become subject to various additional covenants which limit our ability to, among other things:  allow certain subsidiaries that manufacture or process inventory for us or AMD International Sales & Service, Ltd. (together, the Borrowers)
to borrow secured debt or unsecured debt beyond a certain amount;  create any liens upon any of the Borrowers property (other than customary permitted liens and liens on up to $1.5 billion of secured credit
facilities debt (which amount includes our Secured Revolving Line of Credit));  declare or make any distributions;  create any encumbrance on the ability of a subsidiary to make any upstream payments;  make asset dispositions other than certain ordinary course dispositions;  make certain loans, make payments with respect to subordinated debt or certain borrowed money prior to its due date;  become a party to certain agreements restricting the Borrowers ability to incur or repay debt, grant liens, make distributions; and  modify loan agreements or enter into any non-arms-length transaction with an affiliate. During a Domestic Cash Trigger Period, we also would be required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio each four-fiscal quarter
period ending on and after March 29, 2014. The agreements governing our notes and our Secured Revolving Line of Credit
contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross defaults under agreements covering other borrowings. For example, the occurrence of a default with respect to any indebtedness or any failure to
repay debt when due in an amount in excess of $50 million would cause a cross default under the indentures governing our 7.75% Notes, 7.50% Notes, 7.00% Notes, 6.75% Notes and 6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2015 (6.00% Notes), as well as under
our Secured Revolving Line of Credit. The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable note holders or the lenders under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit to declare all amounts outstanding under
those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable. If the note holders or the trustee under the indentures governing our 7.75% Notes, 7.50% Notes, 7.00% Notes, 6.75% Notes or 6.00% Notes or the lenders under our Secured Revolving Line
of Credit accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings. 22 Table of Contents The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive. The markets in which our products are sold are very competitive and delivering the latest and best products to market on a timely basis is
critical to achieving revenue growth. We believe that the main factors that determine our product competitiveness are timely product introductions, product quality (including enabling state-of-the-art visual experience), power consumption (including
battery life), reliability, processor clock speed, perfomance, size (or form factor), selling price, cost, adherence to industry standards (and the creation of open industry standards), level of integration, software and hardware compatibility and
stability, brand recognition and availability. We expect that competition will continue to be intense due to rapid
technological changes, frequent product introductions by our competitors or new competitors of products that may provide better performance/experience or may include additional features that render our products uncompetitive. We may also face
aggressive pricing by competitors, especially during challenging economic times. Some competitors may have greater access or rights to companion technologies, including interface, processor and memory technical information. With the introduction of
our APU products and other competing solutions, we believe that demand for additional discrete graphic cards may decrease in the future due to both the improvement of the quality of our competitors integrated graphics and the graphics
performance of our APUs. If competitors introduce competitive new products into the market before us, demand for our products could be adversely impacted and our business could be adversely affected. We are implementing a long-term business strategy to refocus our business to address markets beyond our core PC market to the high-growth
adjacent markets. However, we are entering markets with new and different competitors who may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirements and emerging technologies. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against
current or new competitors who may have stronger positions in these new markets or superior ability to anticipate customer requirements and emerging industry trends. The loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on us. Collectively, our top five customers accounted for approximately 61% of our net revenue in 2014. On a segment basis, during 2014, five customers accounted for approximately 54% of the net revenue of our
Computing and Graphics segment and five customers accounted for approximately 90% of the net revenue of our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. We expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of
revenues of our businesses in the future. If one of our key customers decides to stop buying our products, or if one of these customers materially reduces its operations or its demand for our products, our business would be materially adversely
affected. Our receipt of revenue from our semi-custom SoC products is dependent upon our technology being designed into third-party
products and the success of those products. The revenue that we receive from our semi-custom SoC products is in the
form of non-recurring engineering fees charged to third parties for design and development services and revenue received in connection with sales of our semi-custom SoC products to these third parties. As a result, our ability to generate revenue
from our semi-custom products depends on our ability to secure customers for our semi-custom design pipeline and our semi-custom SoC products being incorporated into those customers products. Any revenue from sales of our semi-custom SoC
products is directly related to sales of the third-partys products and reflective of their success in the market. Moreover, we have no control over the marketing efforts of these third parties, and we cannot make any assurances that sales of
their products will be successful in current or future years. Consequently, the semi-custom SoC product revenue expected by us may not be fully realized and our operating results may be adversely affected. 23 Table of Contents The demand for our products depends in part on the market conditions in the industries into which they
are sold. Fluctuations in demand for our products or a market decline in any of these industries could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. A significant portion of our business is currently dependent upon the market for desktop PCs and notebooks. Form
factors continue to shift from desktop PCs and notebooks to tablets. Historically, a significant portion of our Computing and Graphics revenue has been related to desktop PCs. Currently, a large portion of our business is focused on the consumer PC
portions of the market, which has experienced a decline driven by the adoption of smaller form factors and increased competition. Industry-wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may
materially adversely affect us in the future. The success of our semi-custom SoC products is dependent on securing customers for our semi-custom design pipeline and consumer market conditions, including the success of the Sony PlayStation ® 4 and Microsoft Xbox One game console systems worldwide. Our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property. In the design and development of new products and product enhancements, we rely on third-party intellectual property such as software
development tools and hardware testing tools. Furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties. The design requirements necessary to meet consumer demand for more features and greater functionality
from semiconductor products may exceed the capabilities of the third-party intellectual property or development tools available to us. If the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable, is not available in the time frame or
price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet customer demands, our business could be materially adversely affected. We depend on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, BIOS software and other computer platform components to support our business. We depend on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, BIOS software and other components that our
customers utilize to support our microprocessor, GPU and APU offerings. We also rely on AIBs to support our GPU and APU products. In addition, our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with
Intel microprocessors. If the designers, manufacturers, AIBs and suppliers of motherboards and other components decrease their support for our product offerings, our business could be materially adversely affected. If we lose Microsoft Corporations support for our products or other software vendors do not design and develop software to run on our
products, our ability to sell our products could be materially adversely affected. Our ability to innovate beyond the
x86 instruction set controlled by Intel depends partially on Microsoft designing and developing its operating systems to run on or support our x86-based microprocessor products. With respect to our graphics products, we depend in part on Microsoft
to design and develop its operating system to run on or support our graphics products. Similarly, the success of our products in the market, such as our APU products, is dependent on independent software providers designing and developing software
to run on our products. If Microsoft does not continue to design and develop its operating systems so that they work with our x86 instruction sets or does not continue to develop and maintain their operating systems to support our graphics products,
independent software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase PCs with our products. In addition, some software drivers sold with our products are certified by
Microsoft. If Microsoft did not certify a driver, or if we otherwise fail to retain the support of Microsoft or other software vendors, our ability to market our products would be materially adversely affected. 24 Table of Contents We may incur future impairments of goodwill. We perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year. Based on the annual goodwill
impairment analysis that we conducted during the fourth quarter of 2014, we concluded that the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to our Computing and Graphics reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value, and accordingly, we recorded a
goodwill impairment charge of $233 million, which represented the entire goodwill balance within this reporting unit. Subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we monitor for any events or changes in circumstances, such as
significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in managements business strategy, an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace, an inability to successfully achieve internal forecasts or
significant declines in our stock price, which may represent an indicator of goodwill impairment. The occurrence of any of these events may require us to record goodwill impairment charges in the future. Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us. We typically sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders. We generally do not have long-term supply arrangements with our
customers or minimum purchase requirements except that orders generally must be for standard pack quantities. Generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. We
base our inventory levels in part on customers estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. Our
ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our products are sold indirectly through downstream channel distributors and customers, as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties throughout the
downstream channel. PC and consumer markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid
obsolescence and price erosion. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. We may build inventories during periods of anticipated growth, and the cancellation or deferral of product orders or
overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize, could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins. Factors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of the value of our inventory, a reduction in
the average selling price or a reduction in our gross margin include:  a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products;  a production or design defect in our products;  a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements;  a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or  our competitors taking aggressive pricing actions. Because market conditions are uncertain, these and other factors could materially adversely affect our business. Our reliance on third-party distributors and AIB partners subjects us to certain risks. We market and sell our products directly and through third-party distributors and AIB partners pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to
the other party. These agreements are non-exclusive and permit both our distributors and AIBs to offer our competitors products. We are dependent on our distributors and AIBs to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts. If 25 Table of Contents any significant distributor or AIB or a substantial number of our distributors or AIBs terminated their relationship with us, decided to market our competitors products over our products or
decided not to market our products at all, our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected. If we are unable to manage the risks related to the use of our third-party distributors and AIB
partners or offer the appropriate incentives to focus them on the sale of our products, our business could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, distributors and AIBs typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions,
as well as provide return rights for any product that we have removed from our price book and that is not more than 12 months older than the manufacturing code date. Some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation
provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Our agreements with AIBs protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. We defer the gross margins on our sales to distributors and AIBs, resulting from both our deferral of
revenue and related product costs, until the applicable products are re-sold by the distributors or the AIBs. However, in the event of a significant decline in the price of our products, the price protection rights we offer would materially
adversely affect us because our revenue and corresponding gross margin would decline. Our inability to continue to attract and retain
qualified personnel may hinder our product development programs. Much of our future success depends upon the continued
service of numerous qualified engineering, marketing, sales and executive personnel. If we are not able to continue to attract, train and retain qualified personnel necessary for our business, the progress of our product development programs could
be hindered, and we could be materially adversely affected. To help attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, we use share-based incentive awards such as employee stock options and non-vested share units (restricted stock units). If the
value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock, or if our share-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, our ability to attract, retain and motivate
personnel could be weakened, which could harm our results of operations. In addition, our current and any future restructuring plans may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain key employees. In the event of a change of control, we may not be able to repurchase our outstanding debt as required by the applicable indentures and our Secured
Revolving Line of Credit, which would result in a default under the indentures and our Secured Revolving Line of Credit. Upon a change of control, we will be required to offer to repurchase all of our 7.75% Notes, 7.50% Notes, 7.00% Notes and 6.75% Notes then
outstanding at 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the repurchase date, and to offer to repurchase all of our 6.00% Notes then outstanding at 100% of the principal amount thereof,
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding the repurchase date. In addition, a change of control would be an event of default under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit. As of December 27, 2014, $130 million debt was
outstanding under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit and $2.07 billion was outstanding under our notes. Future debt agreements may contain similar provisions. We may not have the financial resources to repurchase our outstanding notes and prepay
all of our outstanding obligations under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has
experienced severe downturns that have materially adversely affected, and may continue to materially adversely affect, our business in the future. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced significant downturns, often in conjunction with constant and rapid technological change, wide fluctuations in supply and demand,
continuous 26 Table of Contents new product introductions, price erosion and declines in general economic conditions. We have incurred substantial losses in recent downturns, due to:  substantial declines in average selling prices;  the cyclical nature of supply/demand imbalances in the semiconductor industry;  a decline in demand for end-user products (such as PCs) that incorporate our products; and  excess inventory levels. Industry-wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future. Currently, a large portion of our business is
focused on the consumer PC portions of the market, which has experienced a decline driven by the adoption of smaller form factors and increased competition. Global economic uncertainty and weakness have also impacted the semiconductor market as consumers and businesses have deferred purchases, which negatively impacted demand for our products. Our financial
performance has been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by these downturns. The growth of our business is also
dependent on continued demand for our products from high-growth adjacent emerging global markets. Our ability to be successful in such markets depends in part on our ability to establish adequate local infrastructure, as well as our ability to
cultivate and maintain local relationships in these markets. If demand from these markets is below our expectations, sales of our products may decrease, which would have a material adverse effect on us. Our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems and modification or interruption
of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls. We rely upon a number of internal business
processes and information systems to support key business functions, and the efficient operation of these processes and systems is critical to our business. Our business processes and information systems need to be sufficiently scalable to support
the growth of our business and may require modifications or upgrades that expose us to a number of operational risks. As such, our information systems will continually evolve and adapt in order to meet our business needs. These changes may be costly
and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time. These changes may also require
changes in our information systems, modification of internal control procedures and significant training of employees and third-party resources. We continuously work on simplifying our information systems and applications through consolidation and
standardization efforts. There can be no assurance that our business and operations will not experience any disruption in connection with this transition. Our information technology systems, and those of third-party information technology providers
or business partners, may also be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control including catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, viruses or malware, cyber-attacks, data breaches and
computer system or network failures, exposing us to significant cost, reputational harm and disruption or damage to our business. In addition, as our IT environment continues to evolve, we are embracing new ways of communicating and sharing data internally and externally with customers and partners using methods such as mobility and
the cloud that can promote business efficiency. However, these practices can also result in a more distributed IT environment, making it more difficult for us to maintain visibility and control over internal and external users, and meet scalability
and administrative requirements. If our security controls cannot keep pace with the speed of these changes, or if we are not able to meet regulatory and compliance requirements, our business would be materially adversely affected. 27 Table of Contents Data breaches and cyber-attacks could compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive
information and cause significant damage to our business and reputation. In the ordinary course of our business, we
maintain sensitive data on our networks, including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information relating to our business and that of our customers and business partners. The secure maintenance of this information is
critical to our business and reputation. We believe that companies have been increasingly subject to a wide variety of security incidents, cyber-attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access. These threats can come from a variety of
sources, all ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker to a state-sponsored attack. Cyber threats may be generic, or they may be custom-crafted against our information systems. Over the past year, cyber-attacks have become more prevalent
and much harder to detect and defend against. Our network and storage applications may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions. It is often difficult to anticipate or
immediately detect such incidents and the damage caused by such incidents. These data breaches and any unauthorized access or disclosure of our information or intellectual property could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive
business information. Cyber-attacks could also cause us to incur significant remediation costs, result in product development delays, disrupt key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources. These
incidents could also subject us to liability, expose us to significant expense and cause significant harm to our reputation and business. Our operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal sales patterns. A substantial portion of our quarterly sales have historically been made in the last month of the quarter. This uneven sales pattern makes
prediction of revenues for each financial period difficult and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition. In addition, our operating results tend to vary seasonally. For example, historically, first
quarter PC product sales are generally lower than fourth quarter sales. In addition, with respect to our semi-custom SoC products for game consoles, we expect sales patterns to follow the seasonal trends of a consumer business with sales in the
first half of the year being lower than sales in the second half of the year. Many of the factors that create and affect quarterly and seasonal trends are beyond our control. If essential equipment or materials are not available to manufacture our products, we could be materially adversely affected. We purchase equipment and materials for our internal back-end manufacturing operations from a number of suppliers and our operations
depend upon obtaining deliveries of adequate supplies of equipment and materials on a timely basis. Our third-party suppliers also depend on the same timely delivery of adequate quantities of equipment and materials in the manufacture of our
products. Certain equipment and materials that are used in the manufacture of our products are available only from a limited number of suppliers, or in some cases, a sole supplier. We also depend on a limited number of suppliers to provide the
majority of certain types of integrated circuit packages for our microprocessors, including our APU products. Similarly, certain non-proprietary materials or components such as memory, printed circuit boards (PCBs), substrates and capacitors used in
the manufacture of our products are currently available from only a limited number of sources. Because some of the equipment and materials that we and our third-party manufacturing suppliers purchase are complex, it is sometimes difficult to
substitute one supplier for another. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supply or increase prices due
to capacity constraints or other factors. Also, some of these materials and components may be subject to rapid changes in price and availability. Interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in
various essential materials. Dependence on a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers exacerbates these risks. If we are unable to procure certain of these materials for our back-end manufacturing operations, or our third-party foundries or
manufacturing suppliers are unable to procure materials for manufacturing our products, our business would be materially adversely affected. 28 Table of Contents If our products are not compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware, we could
be materially adversely affected. Our products may not be fully compatible with some or all industry-standard software
and hardware. Further, we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problems in a timely manner. If our customers are unable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware, we could be materially adversely affected. In addition,
the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our products could have a material adverse effect on our business. Costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us. Products as complex as those we offer may contain defects or failures when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements to
existing products are released. We cannot assure you that, despite our testing procedures, errors will not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments in the future, which could result in loss of or delay in
market acceptance of our products, material recall and replacement costs, delay in recognition or loss of revenues, writing down the inventory of defective products, the diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from product
development efforts, defending against litigation related to defective products or related property damage or personal injury and damage to our reputation in the industry and could adversely affect our relationships with our customers. In addition,
we may have difficulty identifying the end customers of the defective products in the field. As a result, we could incur substantial costs to implement modifications to correct defects. Any of these problems could materially adversely affect our
business. We could be subject to potential product liability claims if one of our products causes, or merely appears to have
caused, an injury. Claims may be made by consumers or others selling our products, and we may be subject to claims against us even if an alleged injury is due to the actions of others. A product liability claim, recall or other claim with respect to
uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we fail
to maintain the efficiency of our supply chain as we respond to changes in customer demand for our products, our business could be materially adversely affected. Our ability to meet customer demand for our products depends, in part, on our ability to deliver the products our customers want on a timely basis. Accordingly, we rely on our supply chain for the
manufacturing, distribution and fulfillment of our products. As we continue to grow our business, expand to high-growth adjacent markets, acquire new customers and strengthen relationships with existing customers, the efficiency of our supply chain
will become increasingly important because many of our customers tend to have specific requirements for particular products, and specific time-frames in which they require delivery of these products. If we are unable to consistently deliver the
right products to our customers on a timely basis in the right locations, our customers may reduce the quantities they order from us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We outsource to third parties certain supply-chain logistics functions, including portions of our product distribution, transportation management
and information technology support services. We rely on third-party providers to operate our regional product
distribution centers and to manage the transportation of our work-in-process and finished products among our facilities, to our manufacturing suppliers and to our customers. In addition, we rely on third parties to provide certain information
technology services to us, including help desk support, desktop application services, business and software support applications, server and storage administration, data center operations, database administration and voice, video and remote access.
We cannot guarantee that these providers will fulfill their respective responsibilities in a timely manner in accordance with the contract terms, in which case our internal operations and the distribution of our products to 29 Table of Contents our customers could be materially adversely affected. Also, we cannot guarantee that our contracts with these third-party providers will be renewed, in which case we would have to transition
these functions in- house or secure new providers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business if the transition is not executed appropriately. Acquisitions could disrupt our business, harm our financial condition and operating results or dilute, or adversely affect the price of, our common stock. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to expand our product offerings and grow our business in response to changing
technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures. In some circumstances, we may pursue growth through the acquisition of complementary businesses, solutions or technologies rather than through internal development. The identification of
suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions. Moreover, if such acquisitions require us to seek additional debt or equity financing, we may not
be able to obtain such financing on terms favorable to us or at all. Even if we successfully complete an acquisition, we may not be able to assimilate and integrate effectively or efficiently the acquired business, technologies, solutions, assets,
personnel or operations, particularly if key personnel of the acquired company decide not to work for us. Acquisitions may also involve the entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience. Consequently, we
may not achieve anticipated benefits of the acquisitions which could harm our operating results. In addition, to complete an acquisition, we may issue equity securities, which would dilute our stockholders ownership and could adversely affect
the price of our common stock, as well as incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or have amortization expenses and write-downs of acquired assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Acquisitions may also reduce our cash
available for operations and other uses, which could harm our business. Our worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and
economic risks and natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We maintain operations around
the world, including in the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia. We rely on third-party wafer foundries in Europe and Asia. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of our products is performed at manufacturing facilities, operated by us as
well as third-party manufacturing facilities, in China, Malaysia and Taiwan. We also have international sales operations. International sales, as a percent of net revenue, were 81% in 2014. We expect that international sales will continue to be a
significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. The political, legal and economic risks associated with our
operations in foreign countries include, without limitation:  expropriation;  changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions;  changes in tax laws, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;  difficulties in protecting our intellectual property;  difficulties in managing staffing and exposure to different employment practices and labor laws;  changes in foreign currency exchange rates;  restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions;  changes in freight and interest rates;  disruption in air transportation between the United States and our overseas facilities;  loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs; and  compliance with U.S. laws and regulations related to international operations, including export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations and
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. 30 Table of Contents In addition, our worldwide operations (or those of our business partners) could be subject
to natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding, typhoons and volcanic eruptions that disrupt manufacturing or other operations. For example, our Sunnyvale operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. Any
conflict or uncertainty in the countries in which we operate, including public health issues (for example, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as Avian Influenza, measles or Ebola), safety issues, natural disasters, fire, disruptions of service
from utilities, nuclear power plant accidents or general economic or political factors, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any of the above risks, should they occur, could result in an increase in the cost of components,
production delays, general business interruptions, delays from difficulties in obtaining export licenses for certain technology, tariffs and other barriers and restrictions, longer payment cycles, increased taxes, restrictions on the repatriation of
funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business. Worldwide political conditions may adversely affect demand for our products. Worldwide political conditions may create uncertainties that could adversely affect our business. The United States has been and may continue to be involved in armed conflicts that could have a further
impact on our sales and our supply chain. The consequences of armed conflict, political instability or civil or military unrest are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us. Terrorist
attacks or other hostile acts may negatively affect our operations, or adversely affect demand for our products, and such attacks or related armed conflicts may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. Furthermore,
these attacks or hostile acts may make travel and the transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive, which could materially adversely affect us. Any of these events could cause consumer spending to decrease or result in increased
volatility in the United States economy and worldwide financial markets. Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could
adversely affect us. We have costs, assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies. As a
consequence, movements in exchange rates could cause our foreign currency denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue, affecting our profitability and cash flows. Whenever we believe appropriate, we hedge a portion of our short-term
foreign currency exposure to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We determine our total foreign currency exposure using projections of long-term expenditures for items such as payroll. We cannot assure you that these activities
will be effective in reducing foreign exchange rate exposure. Failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. In addition, the majority of our product sales are denominated in
U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the local currency can cause increases or decreases in the cost of our products in the local currency of such customers. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the
local currency could reduce sales of our products. Our inability to effectively control the sales of our products on the gray market
could have a material adverse effect on us. We market and sell our products directly to OEMs and through authorized
third-party distributors. From time to time, our products are diverted from our authorized distribution channels and are sold on the gray market. Gray market products result in shadow inventory that is not visible to us, thus making it
difficult to forecast demand accurately. Also, when gray market products enter the market, we and our distribution channels compete with these heavily discounted gray market products, which adversely affects demand for our products and negatively
impact our margins. In addition, our inability to control gray market activities could result in customer satisfaction issues because any time products are purchased outside our authorized distribution channels there is a risk that our customers are
buying counterfeit or substandard products, including products that may have been altered, mishandled or damaged, or are used products represented as new. 31 Table of Contents If we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property in the United States and
abroad, through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other measures, we may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses. We rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts, including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements, copyrights, patents, trademarks and common law rights, such as trade secrets, to
protect our intellectual property. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property from third-party infringement or from misappropriation in the United States and abroad. Any
patent licensed by us or issued to us could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or rights granted there under may not provide a competitive advantage to us. Furthermore, patent applications that we file may not result in issuance of a patent or, if a patent is issued, the patent may not be issued in a form that is advantageous to us. Despite our efforts to
protect our intellectual property rights, others may independently develop similar products, duplicate our products or design around our patents and other rights. In addition, it is difficult to monitor compliance with, and enforce, our intellectual
property on a worldwide basis in a cost-effective manner. In jurisdictions where foreign laws provide less intellectual property protection than afforded in the United States and abroad, our technology or other intellectual property may be
compromised, and our business would be materially adversely affected. We are party to litigation and may become a party to other claims
or litigation that could cause us to incur substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit us from selling our products. From time to time, we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions. For example, on January 15, 2014 and March 20, 2014, complaints were filed against us seeking damages for alleged
securities law violations, which are described in Note 16 of our consolidated financial statements. We also sell products to consumers, which could increase our exposure to consumer actions such as product liability claims. On occasion, we receive
claims that individuals were allegedly exposed to substances used in our former semiconductor wafer manufacturing facilities and that this alleged exposure caused harm. Litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions, and its outcome is
uncertain. Any claim that is successfully asserted against us, including claims in the January 15, 2014 and March 20, 2014 complaints filed against us, may result in the payment of damages that could be material to our business. With respect to intellectual property litigation, from time to time, we have been notified of, or third parties may bring or
have brought, actions against us and/or against our customers based on allegations that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others, contributing to or inducing the infringement of the intellectual property rights of others,
improperly claiming ownership of intellectual property or otherwise improperly using the intellectual property of others. If any such claims are asserted, we may seek to obtain a license under the third parties intellectual property rights. We
cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain all of the necessary licenses on satisfactory terms, if at all. These parties may file lawsuits against us or our customers seeking damages (potentially up to and including treble damages) or an
injunction against the sale of products that incorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of our business as presently conducted, which could result in our having to stop the sale of some of our products or to
increase the costs of selling some of our products or which could damage our reputation. The award of damages, including material royalty payments, or the entry of an injunction against the manufacture and sale of some or all of our products could
have a material adverse effect on us. We could decide, in the alternative, to redesign our products or to resort to litigation to challenge such claims. Such challenges could be extremely expensive and time-consuming regardless of their merit, could
cause delays in product release or shipment and/or could have a material adverse effect on us. We cannot assure you that litigation related to our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others can always be avoided or
successfully concluded. Even if we were to prevail, any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the
attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on us. 32 Table of Contents A variety of environmental laws that we are subject to could result in additional costs and
liabilities. Our operations and properties have in the past and continue to be subject to various United States and
foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to materials used in our products and manufacturing processes, discharge of pollutants into the environment, the treatment, transport, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous
wastes and remediation of contamination. These laws and regulations require us to obtain permits for our operations, including the discharge of air pollutants and wastewater. Although our management systems are designed to maintain compliance, we
cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws, regulations and permits. If we violate or fail to comply with any of them, a range of consequences could result, including fines, suspension of
production, alteration of manufacturing processes, import/export restrictions, sales limitations, criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of exposure to hazardous
materials used, stored, released, disposed of by us or located at, under or emanating from our facilities or other environmental or natural resource damage. While we have budgeted for foreseeable associated expenditures, we cannot assure you that
future environmental legal requirements will not become more stringent or costly in the future. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws, and our liabilities arising
from past and future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances will not have a material adverse effect on us. Certain
environmental laws, including the U.S. Comprehensive, Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or the Superfund Act, impose strict or, under certain circumstances, joint and several liability on current and previous owners or
operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances and impose liability for damages to natural resources. These laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of, or was not responsible
for, the release of such hazardous substances. These environmental laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated. Such
persons can be responsible for cleanup costs even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility. We have been named as a responsible party at three Superfund sites in Sunnyvale, California. Although we have not yet been, we could be
named a potentially responsible party at other Superfund or contaminated sites in the future. In addition, contamination that has not yet been identified could exist at our other facilities. Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. For example, the European Union
(EU) and China are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted restrictions on the use of lead and other materials in electronic products. These regulations affect semiconductor devices and packaging. As regulations restricting
materials in electronic products continue to increase around the world, there is a risk that the cost, quality and manufacturing yields of products that are subject to these restrictions, may be less favorable compared to products that are not
subject to such restrictions, or that the transition to compliant products may not meet customer roadmaps, or produce sudden changes in demand, which may result in excess inventory. A number of jurisdictions including the EU, Australia and China are
developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulations for computers and servers based on ENERGY STAR specifications as well as additional energy consumption limits. There is the potential for certain of our products being
excluded from some of these markets which could materially adversely affect us. Recent U.S. legislation includes disclosure
and reporting requirements for companies who use conflict minerals that originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries. We will likely incur additional costs associated with complying with these requirements, such
as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products, auditing the process and reporting to our customers and the U.S. government. Also, since our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges if we
are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the subject minerals. Moreover, we are likely to encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict free. If
we cannot satisfy these customers, they may choose a competitors products. 33 Table of Contents Higher health care costs and labor costs could adversely affect our business. With the passage in 2010 of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the ACA), we are required to provide affordable coverage,
as defined in the ACA, to all employees, or otherwise be subject to a payment per employee based on the affordability criteria in the ACA. Many of these requirements will be phased in over a period of time, with the majority of the most impactful
provisions affecting us presently anticipated to begin in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Additionally, some states and localities have passed state and local laws mandating the provision of certain levels of health benefits by some employers.
Increased health care and insurance costs could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, changes in federal or state workplace regulations could adversely affect our ability to meet our financial targets. Our business is subject to potential tax liabilities. We are subject to income taxes in the United States, Canada and other foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary
course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, we cannot assure you that the final determination of any tax audits and
litigation will not be materially different from that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation, there could be a material adverse effect on our
cash, income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made. ITEM 1B
