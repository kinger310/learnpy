# 130. Surrounded Regions
# Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.
#
# A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.
#
# Example:
#
# X X X X
# X O O X
# X X O X
# X O X X
# After running your function, the board should be:
#
# X X X X
# X X X X
# X X X X
# X O X X
# Explanation:
#
# Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means that any 'O' on the border of the board
# are not flipped to 'X'. Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the
# border will be flipped to 'X'. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected
# horizontally or vertically.

# Phase 1: "Save" every O-region touching the border, changing its cells to 'S'.
# Phase 2: Change every 'S' on the board to 'O' and everything else to 'X'.
